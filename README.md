| **[RynnVLA-001: Using Human Demonstrations to Improve Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15212v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |
| **[Manipulation Facing Threats: Evaluating Physical Vulnerabilities in End-to-End Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13174v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[ForceVLA: Enhancing VLA Models with a Force-aware MoE for Contact-rich Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22159v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control.

| **[Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

| **[CollabVLA: Self-Reflective Vision-Language-Action Model Dreaming Together with Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14889v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates, improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[RealMirror: A Comprehensive, Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14687v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

| **[Toward Embodiment Equivariant Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14630v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks, environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments.

| **[CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[SeqVLA: Sequential Task Execution for Long-Horizon Manipulation with Completion-Aware Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14138v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require executing multiple interdependent subtasks in strict sequence, where errors in detecting subtask completion can cascade into downstream failures. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone). Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[GeoAware-VLA: Implicit Geometry Aware Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14117v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Dual-Actor Fine-Tuning of VLA Models: A Talk-and-Tweak Human-in-the-Loop Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13774v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models demonstrate strong generalization in robotic manipulation but face challenges in complex, real-world tasks. While supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101 minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50% success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in efficiency when using dual robots.

| **[AdaThinkDrive: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13769v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajBooster: Boosting Humanoid Whole-Body Manipulation via Trajectory-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11839v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action models show potential to generalize across embodiments but struggle to quickly align with a new robot's action space when high-quality demonstrations are scarce, especially for bipedal humanoids. We present TrajBooster, a cross-embodiment framework that leverages abundant wheeled-humanoid data to boost bipedal VLA. Our key idea is to use end-effector trajectories as a morphology-agnostic interface. TrajBooster (i) extracts 6D dual-arm end-effector trajectories from real-world wheeled humanoids, (ii) retargets them in simulation to Unitree G1 with a whole-body controller trained via a heuristic-enhanced harmonized online DAgger to lift low-dimensional trajectory references into feasible high-dimensional whole-body actions, and (iii) forms heterogeneous triplets that couple source vision/language with target humanoid-compatible actions to post-pre-train a VLA, followed by only 10 minutes of teleoperation data collection on the target humanoid domain. Deployed on Unitree G1, our policy achieves beyond-tabletop household tasks, enabling squatting, cross-height manipulation, and coordinated whole-body motion with markedly improved robustness and generalization. Results show that TrajBooster allows existing wheeled-humanoid data to efficiently strengthen bipedal humanoid VLA performance, reducing reliance on costly same-embodiment data while enhancing action space understanding and zero-shot skill transfer capabilities.

| **[Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11417v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gen-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FastDriveVLA: Efficient End-to-End Driving via Plug-and-Play Reconstruction-based Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23318v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The Better You Learn, The Smarter You Prune: Towards Efficient Vision-language-action Models via Differentiable Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12594v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenHA: A Series of Open-Source Hierarchical Agentic Models in Minecraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13347v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy, but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all pretrained model checkpoints at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/OpenHA</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

| **[VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/villa-x</p></details> |

However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</p></details> | 8pages, 10 figures, |

This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments.

However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://opengalaxea.github.io/G0/</p></details> |
| **[Mechanistic interpretability for steering vision-language-action models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00328v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/CogVLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Project Page: https://jiutian-vl.github.io/CogVLA-page</p></details> |
| **[Pixel Motion as Universal Representation for Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07817v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

| **[Long-VLA: Unleashing Long-Horizon Capability of Vision Language Action Model for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19958v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025; Github Page: https://long-vla.github.io</p></details> |

We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |
| **[Parallel Simulation of Contact and Actuation for Soft Growing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15180v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

| **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>http:...</summary><p>http://chaiying1.github.io/GAF.github.io/project_page/</p></details> |
| **[Online Multi-Robot Coordination and Cooperation with Task Precedence Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15052v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task plans while leveraging task relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures, Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TR-O) August 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a framework for a robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the operating room.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 1st Workshop on Intelligent Cobodied Assistance and Robotic Empowerment (iCARE). 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |
| **[RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D Geometric Keypoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14966v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at: https://github.com/longkukuhi/RoboEye.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

| **[PERAL: Perception-Aware Motion Control for Passive LiDAR Excitation in Spherical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14915v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360 capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments. Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-araVLN: Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06644v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement. The code is available at https://github.com/humphreymunn/GCR-PPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTracker: Learning Universal Whole-Body Motion Tracker for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07356v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving expressive and generalizable whole-body motion control is essential for deploying humanoid robots in real-world environments. In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>three...</summary><p>three-stage universal motion tracker for humanoid robots</p></details> |

This paper investigates the impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task performance in shared workspaces is limited.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Such systems must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools, together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable robotic disassembly.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Robotic System for Chemical Experiment Automation with Dual Demonstration of End-effector and Jig Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11384v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, designing synchronized motions between the robot and experimental jigs remains challenging, especially for flexible experimental automation. This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands. Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories. To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, providing a practical framework for intuitive and adaptable robotic laboratory automation.

Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments.

| **[GestOS: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models to control Any Type of Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14412v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-based Lighting Generation for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01442v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for novel lighting generation on existing real-world human demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting sources. To improve efficiency and maintain consistency across each generated sequence, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the visual quality of the generated sequences, assessing its effectiveness in improving the imitation learning policy performance (38.75\%) under six unseen real-world lighting conditions, and conduct ablation studies on individual modules of the proposed framework. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework: background generation, object texture generation and distractor positioning. The code for the framework will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-actions and video sequences produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-to investigate their potential as a cost-effective data source. Our investigation follows two paradigms: (a) random actions, where we assess their feasibility for autonomously bootstrapping data collection policies, and (b) random exploration video frames, where we evaluate their effectiveness in pre-training parameter-dense networks with self-supervised learning objectives. To minimize human supervision, we first develop a fully automated pipeline that handles episode labeling, termination, and resetting using cloud-based microservices for real-time monitoring. Building on this, we present a large-scale study on the cost-effectiveness of real-world random exploration in a non-trivial two-layer stacking task, drawing on statistical results from 807 hours of random actions, 71 hours of random exploration video (1.28M frames), and 1,260 times of policy evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available and access to the robot environment with the automated pipeline is to be made accessible via cloud service for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-robot Multi-source Localization in Complex Flows with Physics-Preserving Environment Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14228v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</p></details> |  |

Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body-terrain interaction affects large bump traversal of insects and legged robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02527v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02526v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.</p></details> |  |

This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of a production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract security models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static analysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a complex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer proprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in design, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of static cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More significantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting detailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and actuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or notification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the Unitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud infrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from covert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that securing humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI (CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber convergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust security standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to operational systems in critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |

While significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features, based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures.

In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal, graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness, showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://www.ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13780v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion, teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions, thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Insertion of Flexible Cables in Industrial Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13731v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The industrial insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into receptacles presents a significant challenge owing to the need for submillimeter precision when handling the deformable cables. In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m, maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability, and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods, demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page:https://tianlezeng.github.io/EzReal/</p></details> |

A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAR: Scalable LLM-based PDDL Domain Generation for Aerial Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13691v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and automated planning.</p></details> |  |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages in the main text, 22 pages including references and supplementary materials. 3 figures and 3 tables in the main text, 6 figures and 3 tables in supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13574v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer. These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong high-level reasoning capabilities, the lack of safety guarantees limits their direct use in critical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework that integrates LLMs into the decision loop for multi-robot target tracking in dynamic and hazardous environments. Rather than generating control actions directly, LLMs are used to generate task configuration and adjust parameters in a bi-level task allocation and planning problem. We formulate multi-robot coordination for tracking tasks as a bi-level optimization problem, with LLMs to reason about potential hazards in the environment and the status of the robot team and modify both the inner and outer levels of the optimization. This hierarchical approach enables real-time adjustments to the robots' behavior. Additionally, a human supervisor can offer broad guidance and assessments to address unexpected dangers, model mismatches, and performance issues arising from local minima. We validate our proposed framework in both simulation and real-world experiments with comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and showcasing its capability for safe LLM integration for multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their development is limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns, and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings. Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings.

However, their confidence calibration is largely unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences. Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in BMVC 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains, built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts. Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study of Multimodal, Caption-Based, and Hybrid Retrieval Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15211v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature, combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

While recent methods leverage foundation models or multi-modal maps, they often rely on 2D representations and greedy strategies or require additional training or modules with high computation load, limiting performance in complex environments and real applications. We propose WTRP-Searcher, a novel framework that formulates ZSON as a Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem (WTRP), minimizing the weighted waiting time of viewpoints. Using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), we score viewpoints based on object-description similarity, projected onto a 2D map with depth information. An open-vocabulary detector identifies targets, dynamically updating goals, while a 3D embedding feature map enhances spatial awareness and environmental recall. WTRP-Searcher outperforms existing methods, offering efficient global planning and improved performance in complex ZSON tasks. Code and design will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, not all images are equally effective and not all Wikipedia editors are trained in their selection. We propose QuizRank, a novel method of image selection that leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to rank images as learning interventions. Our approach transforms textual descriptions of the article's subject into multiple-choice questions about important visual characteristics of the concept. We utilize these questions to quiz the VLM: the better an image can help answer questions, the higher it is ranked. To further improve discrimination between visually similar items, we introduce a Contrastive QuizRank that leverages differences in the features of target (e.g., a Western Bluebird) and distractor concepts (e.g., Mountain Bluebird) to generate questions. We demonstrate the potential of VLMs as effective visual evaluators by showing a high congruence with human quiz-takers and an effective discriminative ranking of images.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Product Retrieval In Shopping Carts using Hybrid Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14985v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP) is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3) fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of real-time processing for practical retail deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a viable technical solution for future clinical applications.

This paper presents a framework for a robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the operating room.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 1st Workshop on Intelligent Cobodied Assistance and Robotic Empowerment (iCARE). 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARIC: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14860v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.</p></details> | Preprint |

While textual interventions often target semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels: objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks. Our data and code are released at: https://github.com/petergit1/V-SEAM.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |

While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

Current video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias, as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored to each benchmarking dataset in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[PVLM: Parsing-Aware Vision Language Model with Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Deepfake Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14129v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted to IEEE VIS 2025 (IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics)</p></details> |

We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), enabling VLM agents to transform suboptimal trajectories into high-quality training data through self-reflection and human feedback. Given imperfect task demonstrations, a VLM abstracts trajectories into generalized strategies and action annotations by correcting inefficiencies and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These annotations are iteratively refined through human feedback during execution in similar environments. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making when used for retrieval-augmented generation or fine-tuning. As the agent's example library grows, it becomes more efficient at abstracting new examples, requiring less human feedback and fewer environment interactions. ICAL achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. In TEACh dialogue-based instruction following, combining fine-tuning and retrieval on ICAL examples outperforms raw human demonstrations and expert examples by 17.5% in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, retrieval-augmented GPT-4V with ICAL improves task success 1.6x, while fine-tuned Qwen2-VL achieves 2.8x improvement over the base model. In Ego4D action forecasting, we surpass few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. Our approach scales 2x better than raw demonstrations and significantly reduces manual prompt engineering requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the application of prompt learning with VLM in federated learning (FL) scenarios remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning (VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various FL and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.</p></details> |  |

It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.</p></details> | ACL2025 Main |

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts. Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13939v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning" approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample, followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner, leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional techniques primarily capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source code is available in: https://github.com/einsteinxia/EDITS.</p></details> |  |

As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |

Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution for generating safer T2I content.

In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CORL 2025.

This motivates the development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g., oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses 23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters.

However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present CLIP-SVD, a novel multi-modal and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only 0.04% of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD.

| **[Using Visual Language Models to Control Bionic Hands: Assessment of Object Perception and Grasp Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13572v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference, evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape, orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34 snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for effective prosthetic applications.</p></details> | ICAT 2025 |

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://www.anjiecheng.me/sr3d</p></details> |
| **[EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

This paper introduces a framework that accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.</p></details> |  |

However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

While these models excel on web-scale datasets, their robustness to the domain shifts inherent in many real-world applications remains under-explored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of VLM performance on a single-view object captioning task when faced with a controlled, physical domain shift. We compare captioning accuracy across two distinct object sets: a collection of multi-material, real-world tools and a set of single-material, 3D-printed items. The 3D-printed set introduces a significant domain shift in texture and material properties, challenging the models' generalization capabilities. Our quantitative results demonstrate that all tested VLMs show a marked performance degradation when describing the 3D-printed objects compared to the real-world tools. This underscores a critical limitation in the ability of current models to generalize beyond surface-level features and highlights the need for more robust architectures for real-world signal processing applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>http:...</summary><p>http://chaiying1.github.io/GAF.github.io/project_page/</p></details> |

Safety filters have gained increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Vector Symbolic Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE conference</p></details> |

Unlike everyday tasks, scientific tasks are inherently more delicate and complex, requiring agents to possess a higher level of reasoning ability, structured and temporal understanding of their environment, and a strong emphasis on safety. Existing approaches often fail to address these multifaceted requirements. To tackle these challenges, we present DAVIS. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches, DAVIS incorporates structured and temporal memory, which enables model-based planning. Additionally, DAVIS implements an agentic, multi-turn retrieval system, similar to a human's inner monologue, allowing for a greater degree of reasoning over past experiences. DAVIS demonstrates substantially improved performance on the ScienceWorld benchmark comparing to previous approaches on 8 out of 9 elementary science subjects. In addition, DAVIS's World Model demonstrates competitive performance on the famous HotpotQA and MusiqueQA dataset for multi-hop question answering.

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

| **[Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13095v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent, sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

Tree-PCE combines the expressive power of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) with an adaptive partitioning strategy inspired by regression trees. By recursively dividing the input space into hyperrectangular subdomains and fitting localized PCEs, Tree-PCE constructs a piecewise polynomial surrogate that improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The method is particularly well-suited for global sensitivity analysis, enabling direct computation of Sobol' indices from local expansion coefficients and introducing a new class of sensitivity indices derived from the tree structure itself. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world models, including a 2D morphodynamic case, demonstrate that Tree-PCE offers a favorable balance between accuracy and complexity, especially in the presence of discontinuities. While its performance depends on the compromise between the number of subdomains and the degree of local polynomials, this trade-off can be explored using automated hyperparameter optimization frameworks. This opens promising perspectives for systematically identifying optimal configurations and enhancing the robustness of surrogate modeling in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Methodology of Algorithm Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18979v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on algorithms has drastically increased in recent years. Various sub-disciplines of computer science investigate algorithms according to different objectives and standards. This plurality of the field has led to various methodological advances that have not yet been transferred to neighboring sub-disciplines. The central roadblock for a better knowledge exchange is the lack of a common methodological framework integrating the perspectives of these sub-disciplines. It is the objective of this paper to develop a research framework for algorithm engineering. Our framework builds on three areas discussed in the philosophy of science: ontology, epistemology and methodology. In essence, ontology describes algorithm engineering as being concerned with algorithmic problems, algorithmic tasks, algorithm designs and algorithm implementations. Epistemology describes the body of knowledge of algorithm engineering as a collection of prescriptive and descriptive knowledge, residing in World 3 of Popper's Three Worlds model. Methodology refers to the steps how we can systematically enhance our knowledge of specific algorithms. The framework helps us to identify and discuss various validity concerns relevant to any algorithm engineering contribution. In this way, our framework has important implications for researching algorithms in various areas of computer science.</p></details> |  |

Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics, leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score. Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score with a 28% faster inference speed.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We argue that a key ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding true causal inference.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |
| **[Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove a new asymptotic un-equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Imagined Autocurricula](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13341v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

| **[World Modeling with Probabilistic Structure Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09737v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction, involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data, corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomly Sampled Language Reasoning Problems Elucidate Limitations of In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02825v6)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance on a strikingly wide range of problems, they are also known to hallucinate false answers and underperform on less canonical versions of the same tasks. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

| **[One Model for All Tasks: Leveraging Efficient World Models in Multi-Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07945v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.</p></details> | 43 pages, 19 figures |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |
| **[When Do Neural Networks Learn World Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09297v5)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions--even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; ICLR 2025 World Models Workshop (oral, outstanding paper award)</p></details> |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14222v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

| **[MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC 2025); Code available at: https://github.com/swsychen/Offline_vs_Online_in_MBRL</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking Smarter Device Control: Foresighted Planning with a World Model-Driven Code Execution Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16422v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment.

| **[Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated, explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum, dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04676v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 6 pages, presented at CHI 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |
| **[WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccTENS: 3D Occupancy World Model via Temporal Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03887v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel approach to agent design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains andproblems.</p></details> | 6 papges |
| **[Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</p></details> | <details><summary>Persp...</summary><p>Perspective paper for a broader scientific audience.

| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

| **[Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Decentralized Transformers with Centralized Aggregation are Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15836v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
