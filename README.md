| **[CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[SeqVLA: Sequential Task Execution for Long-Horizon Manipulation with Completion-Aware Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14138v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require executing multiple interdependent subtasks in strict sequence, where errors in detecting subtask completion can cascade into downstream failures. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone). Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[GeoAware-VLA: Implicit Geometry Aware Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14117v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Dual-Actor Fine-Tuning of VLA Models: A Talk-and-Tweak Human-in-the-Loop Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13774v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models demonstrate strong generalization in robotic manipulation but face challenges in complex, real-world tasks. While supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101 minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50% success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in efficiency when using dual robots.

| **[AdaThinkDrive: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13769v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajBooster: Boosting Humanoid Whole-Body Manipulation via Trajectory-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11839v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action models show potential to generalize across embodiments but struggle to quickly align with a new robot's action space when high-quality demonstrations are scarce, especially for bipedal humanoids. We present TrajBooster, a cross-embodiment framework that leverages abundant wheeled-humanoid data to boost bipedal VLA. Our key idea is to use end-effector trajectories as a morphology-agnostic interface. TrajBooster (i) extracts 6D dual-arm end-effector trajectories from real-world wheeled humanoids, (ii) retargets them in simulation to Unitree G1 with a whole-body controller trained via a heuristic-enhanced harmonized online DAgger to lift low-dimensional trajectory references into feasible high-dimensional whole-body actions, and (iii) forms heterogeneous triplets that couple source vision/language with target humanoid-compatible actions to post-pre-train a VLA, followed by only 10 minutes of teleoperation data collection on the target humanoid domain. Deployed on Unitree G1, our policy achieves beyond-tabletop household tasks, enabling squatting, cross-height manipulation, and coordinated whole-body motion with markedly improved robustness and generalization. Results show that TrajBooster allows existing wheeled-humanoid data to efficiently strengthen bipedal humanoid VLA performance, reducing reliance on costly same-embodiment data while enhancing action space understanding and zero-shot skill transfer capabilities.

| **[Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11417v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gen-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ForceVLA: Enhancing VLA Models with a Force-aware MoE for Contact-rich Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22159v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control. Code and data will be released at https://sites.google.com/view/forcevla2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastDriveVLA: Efficient End-to-End Driving via Plug-and-Play Reconstruction-based Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23318v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The Better You Learn, The Smarter You Prune: Towards Efficient Vision-language-action Models via Differentiable Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12594v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11480v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenHA: A Series of Open-Source Hierarchical Agentic Models in Minecraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13347v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy, but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all pretrained model checkpoints at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/OpenHA</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

| **[VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/villa-x</p></details> |
| **[SQAP-VLA: A Synergistic Quantization-Aware Pruning Framework for High-Performance Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09090v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08820v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06932v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |
| **[EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21112v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06951v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</p></details> | 8pages, 10 figures, |

This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OpenEgo, a multimodal egocentric manipulation dataset with standardized hand-pose annotations and intention-aligned action primitives. OpenEgo totals 1107 hours across six public datasets, covering 290 manipulation tasks in 600+ environments. We unify hand-pose layouts and provide descriptive, timestamped action primitives. To validate its utility, we train language-conditioned imitation-learning policies to predict dexterous hand trajectories. OpenEgo is designed to lower the barrier to learning dexterous manipulation from egocentric video and to support reproducible research in vision-language-action learning.

Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025; Github Page: https://long-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

However, prevailing VLA decoders either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone, demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[FlowVLA: Thinking in Motion with a Visual Chain of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$). This paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \textbf{conflates} the task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static appearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling often leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by compelling the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame's \textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this principle by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction. By forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns disentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and significantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code is provided in our github repository.</p></details> |  |

The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</p></details> |  |

This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of a production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract security models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static analysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a complex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer proprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in design, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of static cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More significantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting detailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and actuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or notification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the Unitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud infrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from covert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that securing humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI (CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber convergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust security standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to operational systems in critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |

While significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features, based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness.

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures.

We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user attention and presence.

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13780v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion, teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions, thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.</p></details> |  |

In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m, maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability, and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods, demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page:https://tianlezeng.github.io/EzReal/</p></details> |

A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAR: Scalable LLM-based PDDL Domain Generation for Aerial Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13691v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and automated planning.</p></details> |  |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages in the main text, 22 pages including references and supplementary materials. 3 figures and 3 tables in the main text, 6 figures and 3 tables in supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13574v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer. These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong high-level reasoning capabilities, the lack of safety guarantees limits their direct use in critical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework that integrates LLMs into the decision loop for multi-robot target tracking in dynamic and hazardous environments. Rather than generating control actions directly, LLMs are used to generate task configuration and adjust parameters in a bi-level task allocation and planning problem. We formulate multi-robot coordination for tracking tasks as a bi-level optimization problem, with LLMs to reason about potential hazards in the environment and the status of the robot team and modify both the inner and outer levels of the optimization. This hierarchical approach enables real-time adjustments to the robots' behavior. Additionally, a human supervisor can offer broad guidance and assessments to address unexpected dangers, model mismatches, and performance issues arising from local minima. We validate our proposed framework in both simulation and real-world experiments with comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and showcasing its capability for safe LLM integration for multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition for Robust Robot Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13474v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their development is limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns, and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings. Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings.

Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link https://trojanrobot.github.io.</p></details> |  |

A two-layer framework is proposed to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints. Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and 73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean and amplitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13095v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent, sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available at: https://github.com/zhaozijie2022/seqwm-marl</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical Handling of Dynamic Environments in Decentralised Multi-Robot Patrol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13069v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise time between visits to points of interest, within environments where traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods, we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path, achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy, with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet physical constraints and reach the target pose.</p></details> |  |

To this end, digital twins offer a valuable solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance -- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Currently, commonly used evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN, ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in human-centric environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2025 IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Workshop: Advances in Social Navigation: Planning, HRI and Beyond</p></details> |

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |

In the SRN context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work, which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability, design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review for 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We argue that they benefit robot navigation and scene understanding, by directly encoding privileged information on actions, spatial regions, and relations. Interpreting signs in open-world settings remains a challenge owing to the complexity of scenes and signs, but recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) make this feasible. To advance progress in this area, we introduce the task of navigational sign understanding which parses locations and associated directions from signs. We offer a benchmark for this task, proposing appropriate evaluation metrics and curating a test set capturing signs with varying complexity and design across diverse public spaces, from hospitals to shopping malls to transport hubs. We also provide a baseline approach using VLMs, and demonstrate their promise on navigational sign understanding.

This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators.

However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |

To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>$\cop...</summary><p>$\copyright$ 2025 the authors.

The method uses a two stage curriculum: (1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost; and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with targeted simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs major revision</p></details> |

However, it demands robustness against communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions, performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1% success rate).</p></details> |  |

Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic manipulation under uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To address these limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure, air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts. Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Current AI Models Count What We Mean, Not What They See? A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13939v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning" approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample, followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner, leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional techniques primarily capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source code is available in: https://github.com/einsteinxia/EDITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diving into Mitigating Hallucinations from a Vision Perspective for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13836v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |

Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Prompt Refinement for Safer Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13760v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images from text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on how prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution for generating safer T2I content.

In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CORL 2025.

This motivates the development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g., oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses 23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters. In shipwreck scenes, our framework successfully explores and maps the wreck without collisions, requiring 27.5% fewer steps than the vanilla model and achieving 100% coverage, while the vanilla model achieves 60.23% average coverage in our shipwreck environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gen-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present CLIP-SVD, a novel multi-modal and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only 0.04% of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD.

This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability.

| **[Using Visual Language Models to Control Bionic Hands: Assessment of Object Perception and Grasp Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13572v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference, evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape, orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34 snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for effective prosthetic applications.</p></details> | ICAT 2025 |

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://www.anjiecheng.me/sr3d</p></details> |
| **[EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

This paper introduces a framework that accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.</p></details> |  |

However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 23 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Robustness of Open-Source Vision-Language Models to Domain Shift in Object Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19579v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating textual descriptions from visual data. While these models excel on web-scale datasets, their robustness to the domain shifts inherent in many real-world applications remains under-explored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of VLM performance on a single-view object captioning task when faced with a controlled, physical domain shift. We compare captioning accuracy across two distinct object sets: a collection of multi-material, real-world tools and a set of single-material, 3D-printed items. The 3D-printed set introduces a significant domain shift in texture and material properties, challenging the models' generalization capabilities. Our quantitative results demonstrate that all tested VLMs show a marked performance degradation when describing the 3D-printed objects compared to the real-world tools. This underscores a critical limitation in the ability of current models to generalize beyond surface-level features and highlights the need for more robust architectures for real-world signal processing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Rethinking Visual Token Early Dropping in High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13067v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Hierarchical Plant Segmentation via Foundation Segmentation Models and Text-to-image Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09116v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However, segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods. Implementations are available at https://github.com/JunhaoXing/ZeroPlantSeg.</p></details> | WACV 2026 Accepted |

While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored contrastive decoding as a training-free solution. However, these methods typically construct contrastive visual inputs by perturbing the original image, resulting in distorted contrastive distributions, incomplete contrastive signals, and excessive suppression of language priors. Motivated by the observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual inputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can negatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a dynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model behavior. By selectively suppressing language priors, our method reduces hallucinations without compromising the model's performance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, particularly in image captioning, where language priors are especially dominant.</p></details> | Under Review |

Our evaluations cover text-only, image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INLG 2025.

We argue that they benefit robot navigation and scene understanding, by directly encoding privileged information on actions, spatial regions, and relations. Interpreting signs in open-world settings remains a challenge owing to the complexity of scenes and signs, but recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) make this feasible. To advance progress in this area, we introduce the task of navigational sign understanding which parses locations and associated directions from signs. We offer a benchmark for this task, proposing appropriate evaluation metrics and curating a test set capturing signs with varying complexity and design across diverse public spaces, from hospitals to shopping malls to transport hubs. We also provide a baseline approach using VLMs, and demonstrate their promise on navigational sign understanding.

One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, developing specialist medical VLMs requires substantial computational resources and carefully curated datasets, and it remains unclear under which conditions generalist and specialist medical VLMs each perform best. This study highlights the complementary strengths of specialist medical and generalist VLMs. Specialists remain valuable in modality-aligned use cases, but we find that efficiently fine-tuned generalist VLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance in most tasks, particularly when transferring to unseen or rare OOD medical modalities. These results suggest that generalist VLMs, rather than being constrained by their lack of specialist medical pretraining, may offer a scalable and cost-effective pathway for advancing clinical AI development.</p></details> | version 2 |

However, security issues in visual grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image, regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our attack.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 Figures |

Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL20...</summary><p>ACL2025 Main (SAC Highlight Award)</p></details> |

While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[AsyMoE: Leveraging Modal Asymmetry for Enhanced Expert Specialization in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12715v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training. However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups. We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.</p></details> |  |

Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of (1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution (ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches, attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection, offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and reliable future designs.</p></details> |  |

The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications.

We present the first proactive, instance-level, data-use auditing method designed to enable data owners to audit the use of their individual data instances in ML models, providing more fine-grained auditing results than previous work. To do so, our research generalizes previous work integrating black-box membership inference and sequential hypothesis testing, expanding its scope of application while preserving the quantifiable and tunable false-detection rate that is its hallmark. We evaluate our method on three types of visual ML models: image classifiers, visual encoders, and vision-language models (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining (BLIP) models). In addition, we apply our method to evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art approximate unlearning methods. As a noteworthy second contribution, our work reveals that neither method successfully removes the influence of the unlearned data instances from image classifiers and CLIP models, even if sacrificing model utility by $10\%$.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, applying VLMs to navigation poses two key challenges: effectively representing complex environment information and determining \textit{when and how} to query VLMs. Insufficient environment understanding and over-reliance on VLMs (e.g. querying at every step) can lead to unnecessary backtracking and reduced navigation efficiency, especially in continuous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that constructs a multi-layer representation of the environment during navigation. This representation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes. Viewpoints and object nodes facilitate intra-room exploration and accurate target localization, while room nodes support efficient inter-room planning. Building on this representation, we propose a novel two-stage navigation policy, integrating high-level planning guided by VLM reasoning with low-level VLM-assisted exploration to efficiently locate a goal object. We evaluated our approach on three simulated benchmarks (HM3D, RoboTHOR, and MP3D), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the success rate ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 7.1\%$) and navigation efficiency ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 12.5\%$). We further validate our method on a real robot platform, demonstrating strong robustness across 15 object navigation tasks in 10 different indoor environments.

| **[Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Vector Symbolic Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE conference</p></details> |

Unlike everyday tasks, scientific tasks are inherently more delicate and complex, requiring agents to possess a higher level of reasoning ability, structured and temporal understanding of their environment, and a strong emphasis on safety. Existing approaches often fail to address these multifaceted requirements. To tackle these challenges, we present DAVIS. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches, DAVIS incorporates structured and temporal memory, which enables model-based planning. Additionally, DAVIS implements an agentic, multi-turn retrieval system, similar to a human's inner monologue, allowing for a greater degree of reasoning over past experiences. DAVIS demonstrates substantially improved performance on the ScienceWorld benchmark comparing to previous approaches on 8 out of 9 elementary science subjects. In addition, DAVIS's World Model demonstrates competitive performance on the famous HotpotQA and MusiqueQA dataset for multi-hop question answering. To the best of our knowledge, DAVIS is the first RAG agent to employ an interactive retrieval method in a RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

| **[Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13095v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent, sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

Tree-PCE combines the expressive power of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) with an adaptive partitioning strategy inspired by regression trees. By recursively dividing the input space into hyperrectangular subdomains and fitting localized PCEs, Tree-PCE constructs a piecewise polynomial surrogate that improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The method is particularly well-suited for global sensitivity analysis, enabling direct computation of Sobol' indices from local expansion coefficients and introducing a new class of sensitivity indices derived from the tree structure itself. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world models, including a 2D morphodynamic case, demonstrate that Tree-PCE offers a favorable balance between accuracy and complexity, especially in the presence of discontinuities. While its performance depends on the compromise between the number of subdomains and the degree of local polynomials, this trade-off can be explored using automated hyperparameter optimization frameworks. This opens promising perspectives for systematically identifying optimal configurations and enhancing the robustness of surrogate modeling in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Methodology of Algorithm Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18979v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on algorithms has drastically increased in recent years. Various sub-disciplines of computer science investigate algorithms according to different objectives and standards. This plurality of the field has led to various methodological advances that have not yet been transferred to neighboring sub-disciplines. The central roadblock for a better knowledge exchange is the lack of a common methodological framework integrating the perspectives of these sub-disciplines. It is the objective of this paper to develop a research framework for algorithm engineering. Our framework builds on three areas discussed in the philosophy of science: ontology, epistemology and methodology. In essence, ontology describes algorithm engineering as being concerned with algorithmic problems, algorithmic tasks, algorithm designs and algorithm implementations. Epistemology describes the body of knowledge of algorithm engineering as a collection of prescriptive and descriptive knowledge, residing in World 3 of Popper's Three Worlds model. Methodology refers to the steps how we can systematically enhance our knowledge of specific algorithms. The framework helps us to identify and discuss various validity concerns relevant to any algorithm engineering contribution. In this way, our framework has important implications for researching algorithms in various areas of computer science.</p></details> |  |

Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics, leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score. Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score with a 28% faster inference speed.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We argue that a key ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding true causal inference.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |
| **[Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p></details> |  |

Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Imagined Autocurricula](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13341v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

| **[World Modeling with Probabilistic Structure Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09737v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction, involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data, corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomly Sampled Language Reasoning Problems Elucidate Limitations of In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02825v6)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance on a strikingly wide range of problems, they are also known to hallucinate false answers and underperform on less canonical versions of the same tasks. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

| **[One Model for All Tasks: Leveraging Efficient World Models in Multi-Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07945v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.</p></details> | 43 pages, 19 figures |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |

Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions--even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; ICLR 2025 World Models Workshop (oral, outstanding paper award)</p></details> |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14222v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v8)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BriLLM, a brain-inspired large language model that fundamentally redefines the foundations of machine learning through its implementation of Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) learning. This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

| **[MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC 2025); Code available at: https://github.com/swsychen/Offline_vs_Online_in_MBRL</p></details> |

However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment.

| **[Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated, explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum, dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 6 pages, presented at CHI 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccTENS: 3D Occupancy World Model via Temporal Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03887v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel approach to agent design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains andproblems.</p></details> | 6 papges |
| **[Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</p></details> | <details><summary>Persp...</summary><p>Perspective paper for a broader scientific audience.

| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update with recent progresses. 49pages, 25figures, 6tables, github repository avalible in https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey</p></details> |
| **[Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Decentralized Transformers with Centralized Aggregation are Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15836v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Unified Benchmark and Taxonomy of Stochastic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01793v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability, despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[General agents contain world models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622v4)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICML 2025.
