| **[MonoDream: Monocular Vision-Language Navigation with Panoramic Dreaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02549v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>we up...</summary><p>we update the paper supplement</p></details> |
| **[Yanyun-3: Enabling Cross-Platform Strategy Game Operation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12937v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated operation in cross-platform strategy games demands agents with robust generalization across diverse user interfaces and dynamic battlefield conditions. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Uni-Hand: Universal Hand Motion Forecasting in Egocentric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12878v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., "how to interact"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., "when to interact") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of MMTwin (IROS'25)</p></details> |
| **[BridgeEQA: Virtual Embodied Agents for Real Bridge Inspections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12676v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying embodied agents that can answer questions about their surroundings in realistic real-world settings remains difficult, partly due to the scarcity of benchmarks that faithfully capture practical operating conditions. We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery. We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images. Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboAfford++: A Generative AI-Enhanced Dataset for Multimodal Affordance Learning in Robotic Manipulation and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12436v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation and navigation are fundamental capabilities of embodied intelligence, enabling effective robot interactions with the physical world. Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-R: Vision-Language Action Retrieval toward Open-World End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12405v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring open-world situations in an end-to-end manner is a promising yet challenging task due to the need for strong generalization capabilities. In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval. Our experiments on a real-world robotic platform demonstrate strong generalization and exploratory performance in unstructured, unseen environments, even with limited data. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Reasoning under Vision: Understanding Visual-Spatial Cognition in Vision-Language Models for CAPTCHA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06067v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |
| **[DexGraspVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework Towards General Dexterous Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20900v5)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics. A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AttackVLA: Benchmarking Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12149v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to interpret natural-language instructions and perform diverse tasks, yet their integration of perception, language, and control introduces new safety vulnerabilities. Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupled Action Head: Confining Task Knowledge to Conditioning Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12101v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior Cloning (BC) is a data-driven supervised learning approach that has gained increasing attention with the success of scaling laws in language and vision domains. Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Progression of Memory State in Robotic Manipulation: An Object-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11478v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[EcoAlign: An Economically Rational Framework for Efficient LVLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11301v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experiences from Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11298v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TTF-VLA: Temporal Token Fusion via Pixel-Attention Integration for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19257v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[FastDriveVLA: Efficient End-to-End Driving via Plug-and-Play Reconstruction-based Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23318v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[AdaptPNP: Integrating Prehensile and Non-Prehensile Skills for Adaptive Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11052v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

| **[Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03662v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We have released our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniVGGT: Omni-Modality Driven Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10560v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-official/</p></details> |

To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> |

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026. 16 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Humans naturally ground concrete semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Although prior work has introduced diverse environment representations to improve reasoning, auxiliary modalities are often naively concatenated with RGB features, which underutilizes each modality's distinct contribution. We propose a hierarchical Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to enable agents to perceive and ground environments at multiple scales. Specifically, the Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module supports local action prediction by generating view-level descriptions, capturing fine-grained semantics and narrowing the modality gap between instructions and environments. Complementarily, the Depth Enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally builds a trajectory-level depth exploration map, providing a coarse-grained representation of global spatial layout. Extensive experiments show that the hierarchical representation enrichment of SUSA significantly improves navigation performance over the baseline on discrete VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON) and generalizes better to the continuous R2R-CE benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2026, I14 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Audio-VLA: Adding Contact Audio Perception to Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09958v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have achieved significant advances in robotic manipulation recently. However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviors or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviors that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper reviews works that advance agentic applications and architectures, including initial efforts with GPT-style interfaces and more complex systems where AI agents function as coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP-VLA: Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action Model in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09516v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://wm-po.github.io</p></details> |

To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.</p></details> |  |

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Oral |

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/SONIC/</p></details> |

The framework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and structured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded multimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines direct reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways: multimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from feedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context. We evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent teams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under informational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents consistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task Completion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and socialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient communication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text, alongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division. Qualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness, dynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of machine social cognition. These findings indicate that integrating multimodal perception with explicit social learning is critical for developing human-like collaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have identified critical issues in the code implementation that severely deviate from Algorithm 1, invalidating all experimental results and conclusions.

This symbolic compression of visual information creates a modality gap between perception and planning by blurring spatio-temporal relations and discarding fine-grained cues. We introduce FSDrive, a framework that empowers VLAs to "think visually" using a novel visual spatio-temporal CoT. FSDrive first operates as a world model, generating a unified future frame that combines a predicted background with explicit, physically-plausible priors like future lane dividers and 3D object boxes. This imagined scene serves as the visual spatio-temporal CoT, capturing both spatial structure and temporal evolution in a single representation. The same VLA then functions as an inverse-dynamics model to plan trajectories conditioned on current observations and this visual CoT. We enable this with a unified pre-training paradigm that expands the model's vocabulary with visual tokens and jointly optimizes for semantic understanding (VQA) and future-frame prediction. A progressive curriculum first generates structural priors to enforce physical laws before rendering the full scene. Evaluations on nuScenes and NAVSIM show FSDrive improves trajectory accuracy and reduces collisions, while also achieving competitive FID for video generation with a lightweight autoregressive model and advancing scene understanding on DriveLM. These results confirm that our visual spatio-temporal CoT bridges the perception-planning gap, enabling safer, more anticipatory autonomous driving.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation. In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters.</p></details> |  |

CUAs present unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction. GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to human-level reliability.

This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based, diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do VLAs Effectively Inherit from VLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06619v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExpReS-VLA: Specializing Vision-Language-Action Models Through Experience Replay and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06202v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models such as OpenVLA show impressive zero-shot generalization across robotic manipulation tasks but often fail to adapt efficiently to new deployment environments. In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026.

However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Conte...</summary><p>Content: 8 pages 4 figures, conference under review</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often fail to test the full range of cognitive skills needed to process these temporally rich and narratively complex inputs. Therefore, we introduce InfiniBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of models in long video understanding rigorously. InfiniBench offers:(1) Over 1,000 hours of video content, with an average video length of 53 minutes. (2) The largest set of question-answer pairs for long video comprehension, totaling around 87.7 K. (3) Eight diverse skills that span both grounding-based (e.g., scene transitions, character actions) and reasoning-based (e.g., deep context understanding, multi-event linking). (4) Rich annotation formats, including both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. We conducted an in-depth evaluation across both commercial (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and most recent open-source vision-language models such as Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3.0). Results reveal that:(1) Models struggle across the board: Even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.1 % on grounding-based skills, with most models performing near or just above random chance. (2) Strong reliance on world knowledge: Models achieve surprisingly high scores using only metadata (e.g., video titles), highlighting a tendency to rely on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual visual or temporal understanding. (3) Multi-Modal Importance: When provided with full video and subtitle context, however, models show substantial improvements, confirming the critical role of multimodal input in video understanding.

However, as scene complexity and visual distractions increase, policies that perform well in simple settings often experience substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose ImitDiff, a diffusion-based imitation learning policy guided by fine-grained semantics within a dual-resolution workflow. Leveraging pretrained priors of vision-language foundation models, our method transforms high-level instructions into pixel-level visual semantic masks. These masks guide a dual-resolution perception pipeline that captures both global context (e.g., overall layout) from low-resolution observation and fine-grained local features (e.g., geometric details) from high-resolution observation, enabling the policy to focus on task-relevant regions. Additionally, we introduce a consistency-driven diffusion transformer action head that bridges visual semantic conditions and real-time action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitDiff outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language manipulation frameworks, as well as visuomotor imitation learning policies, particularly under increased scene complexity and visual distractions. Notably, ImitDiff exhibits strong generalization in zero-shot settings involving novel objects and visual distractions. Furthermore, our consistency-driven action head achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference speed while maintaining competitive success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVLM: Self-Reflective Multimodal Reasoning for Cross-Dimensional Visual Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10566v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing complex visual content from ambiguous or partially specified instructions remains a core challenge in vision-language modeling. Existing models can contextualize content but often fail to infer the underlying intent within a reference image or scene, leading to inconsistent or misaligned edits. We introduce the Editing Vision-Language Model (EVLM), a system that interprets ambiguous instructions in conjunction with reference visuals to produce precise, context-aware editing prompts. EVLM's key innovation is a reflective reasoning framework that translates subjective user intent into structured, actionable outputs by aligning with human-rated rationales through Reflection-Aware KL-Divergence Target Optimization (RKTO). By combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with RKTO alignment, EVLM captures fine-grained editing preferences without relying on binary supervision. Trained on a dataset of 30,000 CoT examples with human-annotated rationale quality, EVLM achieves substantial gains in alignment with human intent. Experiments across image, video, 3D, and 4D editing tasks show that EVLM generates coherent and high-quality instructions, providing a scalable foundation for multimodal editing and reasoning.</p></details> | Technical Report |

| **[From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13710v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

| **[Towards Affect-Adaptive Human-Robot Interaction: A Protocol for Multimodal Dataset Collection on Social Anxiety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13530v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social anxiety is a prevalent condition that affects interpersonal interactions and social functioning. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses. This work can contribute to research on affect-adaptive human-robot interaction by providing support for robust multimodal detection of social anxiety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Benefits of pErsonalization and behAvioral adaptation in assistive Robots (BEAR 2025), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Informative Communication of Robot Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13226v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a robot is asked to verbalize its plan it can do it in many ways. For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: PAAMS 2022, 20th International Conference on Practical Applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures.

The MU integrates pneumatic actuation, a compliant lattice envelope, and candidate sites for optical waveguide sensing into a single printed body. In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept. This approach advances monolithic soft robotic design by combining reproducible co-design rules with simulation-informed sensor integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 algorithm, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Unidirectional-Road-Network-Based Global Path Planning for Cleaning Robots in Semi-Structured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13048v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical global path planning is critical for commercializing cleaning robots working in semi-structured environments. In the literature, global path planning methods for free space usually focus on path length and neglect the traffic rule constraints of the environments, which leads to high-frequency re-planning and increases collision risks. In contrast, those for structured environments are developed mainly by strictly complying with the road network representing the traffic rule constraints, which may result in an overlong path that hinders the overall navigation efficiency. This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path. Especially, a two-layer potential map is proposed to achieve a guaranteed performance when the starting and the goal points are in complex intersections. Comparative experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Quantitative experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-art, the proposed method guarantees a much better balance between path length and the consistency with the road network.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[APP: A* Post-Processing Algorithm for Robots with Bidirectional Shortcut and Path Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13042v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paths generated by A* and other graph-search-based planners are widely used in the robotic field. Due to the restricted node-expansion directions, the resulting paths are usually not the shortest. Besides, unnecessary heading changes, or zig-zag patterns, exist even when no obstacle is nearby, which is inconsistent with the human intuition that the path segments should be straight in wide-open space due to the absence of obstacles. This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness. Comparative experiments are then carried out to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that APP outperforms the existing methods in planning time, path length as well as the number of unnecessary heading changes. Finally, field navigation experiments are carried out to verify the practicability of APP.</p></details> |  |
| **[SplatSearch: Instance Image Goal Navigation for Mobile Robots using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12972v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Instance Image Goal Navigation (IIN) problem requires mobile robots deployed in unknown environments to search for specific objects or people of interest using only a single reference goal image of the target. This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length. An ablation study confirms the design choices of SplatSearch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://splat-search.github.io/</p></details> |

Training-time strategies like procedural noise injection or learned mappings suffer from data inefficiency due to unrealistic noise simulation, which is often ineffective for grasping tasks that require fine manipulation or dependency on paired datasets heavily. Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection. With only raw depth inputs during deployment, DiffuDepGrasp eliminates computational overhead and achieves a 95.7% average success rate on 12-object grasping with zero-shot transfer and strong generalization to unseen objects.Project website: https://diffudepgrasp.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOPP-DWR: Time-Optimal Path Parameterization of Differential-Driven Wheeled Robots Considering Piecewise-Constant Angular Velocity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12910v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-driven wheeled robots (DWR) represent the quintessential type of mobile robots and find extensive appli- cations across the robotic field. Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted |
| **[A Cooperation Control Framework Based on Admittance Control and Time-varying Passive Velocity Field Control for Human-Robot Co-carrying Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21339v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot co-carrying tasks reveal their potential in both industrial and everyday applications by leveraging the strengths of both parties. Effective control of robots in these tasks requires managing the energy level in the closed-loop systems to prevent potential dangers while also minimizing motion errors to complete the shared tasks. The collaborative tasks pose numerous challenges due to varied human intentions in adapting to workspace characteristics, leading to human-robot conflicts. In this paper, we develop a cooperation control framework for human-robot co-carrying tasks constructed by utilizing reference generator and low-level controller to aim to achieve safe interaction and synchronized human-robot movement. Firstly, the human motion predictions are corrected in the event of prediction errors based on the conflicts measured by the interaction forces through admittance control, thereby mitigating conflict levels. Low-level controller using an energy-compensation passive velocity field control approach allows encoding the corrected motion to produce control torques for the robot. In this manner, the closed-loop robotic system is passive when the energy level exceeds the predetermined threshold, and otherwise. Furthermore, the proposed control approach ensures that the system's kinetic energy is compensated within a finite time interval. The passivity, stability, convergence rate of energy, and power flow regulation are analyzed from theoretical viewpoints. Human-in-the-loop experiments involving 18 participants have demonstrated that the proposed method significantly enhances task performance and reduces human workload, as evidenced by both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, with improvements confirmed by statistical tests (p < 0.05) relative to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Botany Meets Robotics in Alpine Scree Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12526v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to the European Union's Habitat Directive, habitat monitoring plays a critical role in response to the escalating problems posed by biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as Early Access in IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics. 19 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[RoboAfford++: A Generative AI-Enhanced Dataset for Multimodal Affordance Learning in Robotic Manipulation and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12436v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation and navigation are fundamental capabilities of embodied intelligence, enabling effective robot interactions with the physical world. Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

EnerVerse employs a chunk-wise autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we adopt a multi-view video representation, providing rich perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and 3D grounding. Additionally, EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining generative modeling with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forms a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging these innovations, EnerVerse translates 4D world representations into physical actions via a policy head (EnerVerse-A), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. For efficiency, EnerVerse-A reuses features from the first denoising step and predicts action chunks, achieving about 280 ms per 8-step action chunk on a single RTX 4090. Further video demos, dataset samples could be found in our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Learning Adaptive Neural Teleoperation for Humanoid Robots: From Inverse Kinematics to End-to-End Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12390v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual reality (VR) teleoperation has emerged as a promising approach for controlling humanoid robots in complex manipulation tasks. However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

This paper evaluates Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) combined with Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) on the MetaWorld ML10 benchmark, a challenging suite of ten diverse robotic manipulation tasks. We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks. However, we observe a generalization gap that emerges during meta-training, where performance on test tasks plateaus while training task performance continues to improve. Task-level analysis reveals high variance in adaptation effectiveness, with success rates ranging from 0% to 80% across different manipulation skills. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of gradient-based meta-learning for diverse robotic manipulation, and suggest directions for future work in task-aware adaptation and structured policy architectures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we develop and characterize multilayer PVDF actuators with parallel voltage distribution across each layer, bridging a unique design space between brittle high-force PZT stacks and compliant but lower-bandwidth soft polymer actuators. We show the effects of layer thickness and number of layers in actuator performance and their agreement with a first principles model. By varying these parameters, we demonstrate actuators capable of >3 mm of free deflection, >20 mN of blocked force, and >=500 Hz, while operating at voltages as low as 150 volts. To illustrate their potential for robotic integration, we integrate our actuators into a planar, translating microrobot that leverages resonance to achieve locomotion with robustness to large perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Multi-Robot Assembly Planning for Autonomous Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00192v3)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile autonomous robots have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes. However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/sisl/ConstructionBots.jl</p></details> |

However, the design, assembly, and alignment of optical experiments remain predominantly manual, limiting throughput and reproducibility. Automating such experiments is challenging due to the strict, non-negotiable precision requirements and the diversity of optical configurations found in typical laboratories. Here, we introduce a platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to automate free-space optical experiments. The platform translates user-defined goals into valid optical configurations, assembles them using a robotic arm, and performs micrometer-scale fine alignment using a robot-deployable tool. It then executes a range of automated measurements, including beam characterization, polarization mapping, and spectroscopy, with consistency surpassing that of human operators. This work demonstrates the first flexible, AI-driven automation platform for optics, offering a path towards remote operation, cloud labs, and high-throughput discovery in the optical sciences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intermittent Rendezvous Plans with Mixed Integer Linear Program for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12237v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Robot Exploration (MRE) systems with communication constraints have proven efficient in accomplishing a variety of tasks, including search-and-rescue, stealth, and military operations. While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, International Conference on Advanced Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Innovative Design of Multi-functional Supernumerary Robotic Limbs with Ellipsoid Workspace Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12186v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) offer substantial potential in both the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients and the enhancement of functional capabilities for healthy individuals. Designing a general-purpose SRL device is inherently challenging, particularly when developing a unified theoretical framework that meets the diverse functional requirements of both upper and lower limbs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The proposed design theory offers an efficient option for the design of multi-functional SRL mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Impedance Control for Floating-Base Supernumerary Robotic Leg in Walking Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12184v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-robot systems, ensuring safety during force control in the presence of both internal and external disturbances is crucial. As a typical loosely coupled floating-base robot system, the supernumerary robotic leg (SRL) system is particularly susceptible to strong internal disturbances. To address the challenge posed by floating base, we investigated the dynamics model of the loosely coupled SRL and designed a hybrid position/force impedance controller to fit dynamic torque input. An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states. An efficient real-time stability guaranteed impedance parameters generating network is specifically designed for the proposed SRL, to achieve shock mitigation and high rigidity supporting. Simulations and experiments validate the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to maintain smooth signal transitions in flexible states while providing strong support forces in rigid states. This approach provides a practical solution for accommodating individual gait variations in interaction, and significantly advances the safety and adaptability of human-robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whole-Body Control Framework for Humanoid Robots with Heavy Limbs: A Model-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14278v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots often face significant balance issues due to the motion of their heavy limbs. These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Obstacle-Avoiding Control of Planar Snake Robots Exploring Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12148v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to develop a resource-efficient solution for obstacle-avoiding tracking control of a planar snake robot in a densely cluttered environment with obstacles. Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles. The proposed framework has been verified through a physics engine simulation study on PyBullet. The approach shows superior results to existing state-of-the-art methodologies and comparable results to the very recent CBRL approach with significantly lower computational overhead.

However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications. To assess whether such concerns are well placed in the context of HRI, we evaluate several highly-rated LLMs on discrimination and safety criteria. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs are currently unsafe for people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics, including, but not limited to, race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections. Concretely, we show that LLMs produce directly discriminatory outcomes- e.g., 'gypsy' and 'mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not 'european' or 'able-bodied' people. We find various such examples of direct discrimination on HRI tasks such as facial expression, proxemics, security, rescue, and task assignment. Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions-such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so. We provide code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/rumaisa-azeem/llm-robots-discrimination-safety .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Journal of Social Robotics (2025). 49 pages (65 with references and appendix), 27 Figures, 8 Tables.

| **[Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16587v4)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</p></details> |  |

Conventional wheeled or legged robots often struggle in these contexts due to surface variability. This paper presents ARCSnake V2, an amphibious, screw propelled, snake like robot designed for teleoperated or autonomous locomotion across land, granular media, and aquatic environments. ARCSnake V2 combines the high mobility of hyper redundant snake robots with the terrain versatility of Archimedean screw propulsion. Key contributions include a water sealed mechanical design with serially linked screw and joint actuation, an integrated buoyancy control system, and teleoperation via a kinematically matched handheld controller. The robots design and control architecture enable multiple locomotion modes screwing, wheeling, and sidewinding with smooth transitions between them. Extensive experiments validate its underwater maneuverability, communication robustness, and force regulated actuation.

However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |

In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08086v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias. In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks. We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely. Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Progression of Memory State in Robotic Manipulation: An Object-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11478v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Reconfigurable hydrostatics: Toward versatile and efficient load-bearing robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17936v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable and legged robot designers face multiple challenges when choosing actuation. Traditional fully actuated designs using electric motors are multifunctional but oversized and inefficient for bearing conservative loads and for being backdrivable. Alternatively, quasi-passive and underactuated designs reduce the amount of motorization and energy storage, but are often designed for specific tasks. Designers of versatile and stronger wearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very torque-dense, backdrivable and efficient This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue: reconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate a passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still be multifunctional. First, an analytical study compares the effect of these two mechanisms on the motorization requirements in the context of a load-bearing exoskeleton. Then, the hydrostatic concept integrating these two mechanisms using hydraulic components is presented. A case study analysis shows the mass/efficiency/inertia benefits of the concept over a fully actuated one. Then, experiments are conducted on robotic legs to demonstrate that the actuator concept can meet the expected performance in terms of force tracking, versatility, and efficiency under controlled conditions. The proof-of-concept can track the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profiles of walking, running, squatting, and jumping, and the energy consumption is 4.8x lower for walking. The transient force behaviors due to switching from one leg to the other are also analyzed along with some mitigation to improve them.</p></details> |  |

We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sidewalk Robots for Walkability-Related Analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12148v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development. In walkability studies, collecting detailed pedestrian infrastructure data remains challenging due to the high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101 trips covering 900 segment records. From the collected data, different typologies of features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed, duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Learning-Based Control of a Legged Robot in Lunar Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10128v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.</p></details> |  |

This convergence enables machines to perceive, reason and interact with complex environments through natural language and spatial understanding, bridging the gap between linguistic intelligence and spatial perception. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies. We first introduce the foundational principles of LLMs and 3D data representations, followed by an in-depth examination of 3D sensing technologies critical for robotics. The review then explores key advancements in scene understanding, text-to-3D generation, object grounding and embodied agents, highlighting cutting-edge techniques such as zero-shot 3D segmentation, dynamic scene synthesis and language-guided manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, including adaptive model architectures, enhanced cross-modal alignment and real-time processing capabilities, which pave the way for more intelligent, context-aware and autonomous robotic sensing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 15 figures, MDPI Sensors Journal</p></details> |
| **[AdaptPNP: Integrating Prehensile and Non-Prehensile Skills for Adaptive Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11052v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

| **[Dynamic Reconfiguration of Robotic Swarms: Coordination and Control for Precise Shape Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10989v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at the 9th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Systems (ICACS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Terradynamics and design of tip-extending robotic anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10901v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Multi-Robot Non-Prehensile Manipulation via Flow-Matching Co-Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10874v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.</p></details> |  |

GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitting for Neurocomputing</p></details> |

We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding.</p></details> |  |

The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures,The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI 2026),Paper has been accepted for a poster presentation</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Language-Guided Invariance Probing of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13494v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, OpenCLIP, EVA02-CLIP and SigLIP achieve strong zero-shot performance, but it is unclear how reliably they respond to controlled linguistic perturbations. We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic. Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Document Derendering: SVG Reconstruction via Vision-Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13478v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, examining how user trust in VLMs builds and evolves remains an open problem. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing reliance on AI models as judges for experimental validation, to bypass the cost and implications of running participatory design studies directly with users. Following a user-centred approach, this paper presents preliminary results from a workshop with prospective VLM users. Insights from this pilot workshop inform future studies aimed at contextualising trust metrics and strategies for participants' engagement to fit the case of user-VLM interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOPE: Revisiting Hallucination of Vision-Language Models in Voluntary Imagination Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13420v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most research on hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) focuses on factual description tasks that prohibit any output absent from the image. However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13397v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  |

Peirce's Manuscripts with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13378v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/LightCompress.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

This practical trade-off between transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all models should be \textit{identical} across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA), which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity. In this way, the number of within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models, SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency according to specific resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Spatial Intelligence Benchmark for UAV Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13269v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leveraging their powerful visual perception and reasoning capabilities, have been widely applied in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tasks. However, the spatial intelligence capabilities of existing VLMs in UAV scenarios remain largely unexplored, raising concerns about their effectiveness in navigating and interpreting dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpatialSky-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial intelligence capabilities of VLMs in UAV navigation. Our benchmark comprises two categories-Environmental Perception and Scene Understanding-divided into 13 subcategories, including bounding boxes, color, distance, height, and landing safety analysis, among others. Extensive evaluations of various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal unsatisfactory performance in complex UAV navigation scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in their spatial capabilities. To address this challenge, we developed the SpatialSky-Dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing 1M samples with diverse annotations across various scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce Sky-VLM, a specialized VLM designed for UAV spatial reasoning across multiple granularities and contexts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Sky-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmark tasks, paving the way for the development of VLMs suitable for UAV scenarios.

In this work, we start by identifying three core tasks: egocentric procedural error detection, egocentric procedural learning, and egocentric procedural question answering. These tasks define the essential functions of EgoProceAssist within a new taxonomy. Specifically, our work encompasses a comprehensive review of current techniques, relevant datasets, and evaluation metrics across these three core areas. To clarify the gap between the proposed EgoProceAssist and existing VLM-based AI assistants, we introduce novel experiments and provide a comprehensive evaluation of representative VLM-based methods. Based on these findings and our technical analysis, we discuss the challenges ahead and suggest future research directions.

The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |

Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, DeMo assumes that models fit on a single accelerator. We relax this assumption and introduce FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication is reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients -- resulting in a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy. We further introduce a framework, denoted as DeToNATION, that generalizes DeMo, FlexDeMo, and other popular distributed training schemes such as DiLoCo -- introducing new variations of replication schemes and challenging choices made in DeMo. Our results across language and vision domains show that FlexDeMo attains similar validation loss as hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization, while being substantially faster. FlexDeMo is thus a promising distributed training scheme for the largest machine learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> |

We propose Geometric Distillation, a lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3) dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R, VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout).</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026 Under Review</p></details> |

Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches.

Recently, there has been interest in the specific task of \textit{Delta Compression}, where parties each hold a common base model and only communicate compressed weight updates. However, popular parameter efficient updates such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) face inherent representation limitations - which are especially pronounced when combined with aggressive quantization. To overcome this, we build on recent work that improves LoRA representation capacity by using fixed-frequency sinusoidal functions to increase stable rank without adding additional parameters. We extend this to the quantized setting and present the first theoretical analysis showing how stable rank evolves under quantization. From this, we introduce SineLoRA$Δ$, a principled and effective method for delta compression that improves the expressivity of quantized low-rank adapters by applying a sinusoidal activation. We validate SineLoRA$Δ$ across a diverse variety of domains - including language modeling, vision-language tasks, and text-to-image generation - achieving up to 66% memory reduction with similar performance. We additionally provide a novel application of the canonical Bjøntegaard Delta metric to consistently compare adapter compression changes across the rate-distortion curve.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

To meet these requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs). However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this paradigm, we design edgeVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision-lanuage reasoning tasks across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.</p></details> |  |

However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page can be found at https://dinyudin203.github.io/uCLIP-project/</p></details> |

However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages, 21 figures |

However, its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present RadarLLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding from radar signals. RadarLLM introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture, integrating deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to convert spatial-temporal radar sequences into compact semantic tokens; and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To overcome the scarcity of paired radar-text data, we generate a realistic radar-text dataset from motion-text datasets with a physics-aware synthesis pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that RadarLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust and interpretable motion understanding under privacy and visibility constraints, even in adverse environments.

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Uni-Hand: Universal Hand Motion Forecasting in Egocentric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12878v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., "how to interact"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., "when to interact") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of MMTwin (IROS'25)</p></details> |

However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Catastrophic Forgetting in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12828v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting is a longstanding challenge in continual learning, where models lose knowledge from earlier tasks when learning new ones. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, accepted in the main technical track of AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Direct Visual Grounding by Directing Attention of Visual Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12738v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) mix visual tokens and text tokens. A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Attacks on Open Vocabulary Object Detectors via Multi-Modal Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12735v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detectors (OVODs) unify vision and language to detect arbitrary object categories based on text prompts, enabling strong zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. As these models gain traction in high-stakes applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance, understanding their security risks becomes crucial. In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[LAYA: Layer-wise Attention Aggregation for Interpretable Depth-Aware Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12723v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks typically rely on the representation produced by their final hidden layer to make predictions, implicitly assuming that this single vector fully captures the semantics encoded across all preceding transformations. However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations. The code to reproduce LAYA is publicly available at: https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSDAM: Few-Shot Driving Attention Modeling via Vision-Language Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12708v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding where drivers look and why they shift their attention is essential for autonomous systems that read human intent and justify their actions. Most existing models rely on large-scale gaze datasets to learn these patterns; however, such datasets are labor-intensive to collect and time-consuming to curate. We present FSDAM (Few-Shot Driver Attention Modeling), a framework that achieves joint attention prediction and caption generation with approximately 100 annotated examples, two orders of magnitude fewer than existing approaches. Our approach introduces a dual-pathway architecture where separate modules handle spatial prediction and caption generation while maintaining semantic consistency through cross-modal alignment. Despite minimal supervision, FSDAM achieves competitive performance on attention prediction, generates coherent, and context-aware explanations. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across multiple driving benchmarks. This work shows that effective attention-conditioned generation is achievable with limited supervision, opening new possibilities for practical deployment of explainable driver attention systems in data-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaffolding Dexterous Manipulation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19212v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However, sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet") and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws for Conditional Emergence of Multilingual Image Captioning via Generalization from Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09443v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual, cross-task transfer is challenged by task-specific data scarcity, which becomes more severe as language support grows and is further amplified in vision-language models (VLMs). We investigate multilingual generalization in encoder-decoder transformer VLMs to enable zero-shot image captioning in languages encountered only in the translation task. In this setting, the encoder must learn to generate generalizable, task-aware latent vision representations to instruct the decoder via inserted cross-attention layers. To analyze scaling behavior, we train Florence-2 based and Gemma-2 based models (0.4B to 11.2B parameters) on a synthetic dataset using varying compute budgets. While all languages in the dataset have image-aligned translations, only a subset of them include image captions. Notably, we show that captioning can emerge using a language prefix, even when this language only appears in the translation task. We find that indirect learning of unseen task-language pairs adheres to scaling laws that are governed by the multilinguality of the model, model size, and seen training samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the scaling laws extend to downstream tasks, achieving competitive performance through fine-tuning in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).</p></details> |  |
| **[X-VMamba: Explainable Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12694v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication</p></details> |  |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

| **[HEDGE: Hallucination Estimation via Dense Geometric Entropy for VQA with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12693v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) enable open-ended visual question answering but remain prone to hallucinations. We present HEDGE, a unified framework for hallucination detection that combines controlled visual perturbations, semantic clustering, and robust uncertainty metrics. HEDGE integrates sampling, distortion synthesis, clustering (entailment- and embedding-based), and metric computation into a reproducible pipeline applicable across multimodal architectures. Evaluations on VQA-RAD and KvasirVQA-x1 with three representative VLMs (LLaVA-Med, Med-Gemma, Qwen2.5-VL) reveal clear architecture- and prompt-dependent trends. Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses. By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE .</p></details> |  |

We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery. We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images. Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Knowledge Intervention Prompt Tuning for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12639v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown great potential in feature transfer and generalization across a wide spectrum of medical-related downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/usr922/cilmp.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (Early Access) July 2025</p></details> |

To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE. Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches. We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.</p></details> |  |

The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions.

In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026, Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/FFSE/</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers.

| **[From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13710v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

| **[Generalist Foundation Models Are Not Clinical Enough for Hospital Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13703v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ontology-Driven Model-to-Model Transformation of Workflow Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13661v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms & Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

We present OlmoEarth: a multimodal, spatio-temporal foundation model that employs a novel self-supervised learning formulation, masking strategy, and loss all designed for the Earth observation domain. OlmoEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 12 other foundation models across a variety of research benchmarks and real-world tasks from external partners. When evaluating embeddings OlmoEarth achieves the best performance on 15 out of 24 tasks, and with full fine-tuning it is the best on 19 of 29 tasks. We deploy OlmoEarth as the backbone of an end-to-end platform for data collection, labeling, training, and inference of Earth observation models. The OlmoEarth Platform puts frontier foundation models and powerful data management tools into the hands of non-profits and NGOs working to solve the world's biggest problems.

| **[Physically Interpretable World Models via Weakly Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12870v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning predictive models from high-dimensional sensory observations is fundamental for cyber-physical systems, yet the latent representations learned by standard world models lack physical interpretability. This limits their reliability, generalizability, and applicability to safety-critical tasks. We introduce Physically Interpretable World Models (PIWM), a framework that aligns latent representations with real-world physical quantities and constrains their evolution through partially known physical dynamics. Physical interpretability in PIWM is defined by two complementary properties: (i) the learned latent state corresponds to meaningful physical variables, and (ii) its temporal evolution follows physically consistent dynamics. To achieve this without requiring ground-truth physical annotations, PIWM employs weak distribution-based supervision that captures state uncertainty naturally arising from real-world sensing pipelines. The architecture integrates a VQ-based visual encoder, a transformer-based physical encoder, and a learnable dynamics model grounded in known physical equations. Across three case studies (Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Donkey Car), PIWM achieves accurate long-horizon prediction, recovers true system parameters, and significantly improves physical grounding over purely data-driven models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of learning physically interpretable world models directly from images under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Third Pillar of Causal Analysis? A Measurement Perspective on Causal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17708v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis, often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-anything.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |

A critical gap is the lack of a systematic end-to-end view of how sensor induced errors traverse interconnected modules to affect the physical world. To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive survey across platforms, sensing modalities, attack methods, and countermeasures. At its core is \Model (\modelAbbr), a graph-based illustrative framework that maps how attacks inject errors, the conditions for their propagation through modules from perception and localization to planning and control, and when they reach physical impact. From the systematic analysis, our study distills 8 key findings that highlight the feasibility challenges of sensor attacks and uncovers 12 previously overlooked attack vectors exploiting inter-module interactions, several of which we validate through proof-of-concept experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework. To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation. Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784v5)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, uses fancyhdr.sty</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Aethorix v1.0, an AI agent framework designed to overcome key industrial bottlenecks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in materials design innovation and process parameter optimization. Our tool is built upon three pillars: a scientific corpus reasoning engine that streamlines knowledge retrieval and validation, a diffusion-based generative model for zero-shot inverse design, and specialized interatomic potentials that enable faster screening with ab initio fidelity. We demonstrate Aethorix's utility through a real-world cement production case study, confirming its capacity for integration into industrial workflows and its role in revolutionizing the design-make-test-analyze loop while ensuring rigorous manufacturing standards are met.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> |

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

Conventional OCR systems, optimized for clean scans, perform poorly under such real-world conditions. This study evaluates compact multimodal language models as privacy-preserving alternatives for transcribing noisy clinical documents. Using obstetric ultrasound reports written in regionally inflected medical English common to Indian healthcare settings, we compare eight systems in terms of transcription accuracy, noise sensitivity, numeric accuracy, and computational efficiency. Compact multimodal models consistently outperform both classical and neural OCR pipelines. Despite higher computational costs, their robustness and linguistic adaptability position them as viable candidates for on-premises healthcare digitization.</p></details> |  |

Although differential privacy (DP) with private voting is a pragmatic mitigation, DP-ICL implementations are error-prone, and worst-case DP bounds may substantially overestimate actual leakage, calling for practical auditing tools. We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, the manual construction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content continues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming outdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively. As a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to keep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often rely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these embeddings fall short of capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's meaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding context. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, a quantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion that encodes entities in a Hilbert space and models interference effects between them, yielding richer, context-sensitive representations. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that QuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving substantial improvements of 12.3% in accuracy, 11.2% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and 6.9% in Wu & Palmer (Wu&P) metrics across nine classical embedding-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

These reports often contain obfuscated language designed to present a positive or neutral outlook, even when underlying conditions may be less favorable. This paper presents a novel approach using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to decode obfuscated sentiment in Thai financial annual reports. We develop specific guidelines for annotating obfuscated sentiment in these texts and annotate more than one hundred financial reports. We then benchmark various text classification models on this annotated dataset, demonstrating strong performance in sentiment classification. Additionally, we conduct an event study to evaluate the real-world implications of our sentiment analysis on stock prices. Our results suggest that market reactions are selectively influenced by specific aspects within the reports. Our findings underscore the complexity of sentiment analysis in financial texts and highlight the importance of addressing obfuscated language to accurately assess market sentiment.</p></details> |  |

Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Multimodal Large Language Model Framework for Automated Interpretation of Fuel Efficiency Analytics in Public Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13476v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing fuel efficiency in public transportation requires the integration of complex multimodal data into interpretable, decision-relevant insights. However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting.

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 540 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 1 model scores over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Challenges for LLMs in Enterprise Data Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10950v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to automate data engineering on tabular data, offering enterprises a valuable opportunity to cut the high costs of manual data handling. But the enterprise domain comes with unique challenges that existing LLM-based approaches for data engineering often overlook, such as large table sizes, more complex tasks, and the need for internal knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we identify key enterprise-specific challenges related to data, tasks, and background knowledge and extensively evaluate how they affect data engineering with LLMs. Our analysis reveals that LLMs face substantial limitations in real-world enterprise scenarios, with accuracy declining sharply. Our findings contribute to a systematic understanding of LLMs for enterprise data engineering to support their adoption in industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Fusion: Overcoming Shortcut Learning in Sarcasm Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10644v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Conference</p></details> |

Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $κ$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $κ$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing "baby AGI" becomes Superintelligence intuition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13397v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Function as Qualified Pediatricians? A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13381v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive Maps in Language Models: A Mechanistic Analysis of Spatial Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13371v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do large language models solve spatial navigation tasks? We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Machine Translation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06706v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) systems face more challenges than just the quality-latency trade-off. They also need to address issues related to robustness with noisy input, processing long contexts, and flexibility for knowledge injection. These challenges demand models with strong language understanding and generation capabilities which may not often equipped by dedicated MT models. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of applying Large Language Models (LLM) to SimulMT tasks by using existing incremental-decoding methods with a newly proposed RALCP algorithm for latency reduction. We conducted experiments using the \texttt{Llama2-7b-chat} model on nine different languages from the MUST-C dataset. The results show that LLM outperforms dedicated MT models in terms of BLEU and LAAL metrics. Further analysis indicates that LLM has advantages in terms of tuning efficiency and robustness. However, it is important to note that the computational cost of LLM remains a significant obstacle to its application in SimulMT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ALTA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Practical Global and Local Bounds in Gaussian Process Regression via Chaining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09144v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features, and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or the tuning of hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input features. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structures without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI2026</p></details> |

Since databases can store big amount of information with synthetic and organic data, serving all quantity of objects correctly is an important task to deal with. However, the decision of how to construct entity relationship model is associated with human factor. In this paper, we present flow-oriented entity-relationship tool. This is first and unique end-to-end solution that eliminates routine and resource-intensive problems of processing, creating and visualizing both of explicit and implicit dependencies for prominent SQL dialects on-the-fly. Once launched, FLOWER automatically detects built-in constraints and starting to create own correct and necessary one using dynamic sampling and robust data analysis techniques. This approach applies to improve entity-relationship model and data storytelling to better understand the foundation of data and get unseen insights from DB sources using SQL or natural language. Evaluated on state-of-the-art STATS benchmark, experiments show that FLOWER is superior to reservoir sampling by 2.4x for distribution representation and 2.6x for constraint learning with 2.15x acceleration. For data storytelling, our tool archives 1.19x for accuracy enhance with 1.86x context decrease compare to LLM. Presented tool is also support 23 languages and compatible with both of CPU and GPU. Those results show that FLOWER can manage with real-world data a way better to ensure with quality, scalability and applicability for different use-cases.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[TacEleven: generative tactic discovery for football open play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13326v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating offensive advantages during open play is fundamental to football success. However, due to the highly dynamic and long-sequence nature of open play, the potential tactic space grows exponentially as the sequence progresses, making automated tactic discovery extremely challenging. To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations. TacEleven demonstrates the potential of creatively leveraging domain data and generative models to advance tactical analysis in sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11411v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB in challenging MTL environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases. Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios. In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications. SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation.</p></details> | Accepted at ICSE'26 |

While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 52% and 34% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench, RepoEval, and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In this work, we explore whether recent diffusion-based video generation methods (a.k.a. world models), paired with structured 3D layouts, can enable a fully automated pipeline to self-correct such failure cases. We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases. Then, we use a generative model that can simulate both data collection and annotation. However, existing generative models struggle to generate high-fidelity data conditioned on 3D layouts. To address this, we propose DriveSora, which can generate spatiotemporally consistent videos aligned with the 3D annotations requested by PM-Agent. We integrate these components into our self-correcting agentic system, CorrectAD. Importantly, our pipeline is an end-to-end model-agnostic and can be applied to improve any end-to-end planner. Evaluated on both nuScenes and a more challenging in-house dataset across multiple end-to-end planners, CorrectAD corrects 62.5% and 49.8% of failure cases, reducing collision rates by 39% and 27%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Deep Research: Training Multi-Agent Systems with M-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13288v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems perform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMUR: Large scale End-to-end MUltimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10962v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use as Many Surrogates as You Want: Selective Ensemble Attack to Unleash Transferability without Sacrificing Resource Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12644v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all models should be \textit{identical} across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA), which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity. In this way, the number of within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models, SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency according to specific resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal approaches to emotional support show great promise by integrating diverse data sources to provide empathetic, contextually relevant responses, fostering more effective interactions. However, current methods have notable limitations, often relying solely on text or converting other data types into text, or providing emotion recognition only, thus overlooking the full potential of multimodal inputs. Moreover, many studies prioritize response generation without accurately identifying critical emotional support elements or ensuring the reliability of outputs. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textsc{ MultiMood}, a new framework that (i) leverages multimodal embeddings from video, audio, and text to predict emotional components and to produce responses responses aligned with professional therapeutic standards. To improve trustworthiness, we (ii) incorporate novel psychological criteria and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize large language models (LLMs) for consistent adherence to these standards. We also (iii) analyze several advanced LLMs to assess their multimodal emotional support capabilities. Experimental results show that MultiMood achieves state-of-the-art on MESC and DFEW datasets while RL-driven trustworthiness improvements are validated through human and LLM evaluations, demonstrating its superior capability in applying a multimodal framework in this domain.</p></details> |  |

We turn this disagreement into an advantage and introduce EXplanation AGREEment (EXAGREE), a two-stage framework that selects a Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Model (SAEM) from a set of similar-performing models. The selection maximizes Stakeholder-Machine Agreement (SMA), a single metric that unifies faithfulness and plausibility. EXAGREE couples a differentiable mask-based attribution network (DMAN) with monotone differentiable sorting, enabling gradient-based search inside the constrained model space. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate simultaneous gains of faithfulness, plausibility, and fairness over baselines, while preserving task accuracy. Extensive ablation studies, significance tests, and case studies confirm the robustness and feasibility of the method in practice.</p></details> |  |
