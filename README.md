| **[Interleave-VLA: Enhancing Robot Manipulation with Interleaved Image-Text Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02152v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models paves the way for generalist robot policies in the physical world. Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

| **[TrackVLA++: Unleashing Reasoning and Memory Capabilities in VLA Models for Embodied Visual Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07134v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/TrackVLA-plus-plus-Web/</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotics: A Review Towards Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07077v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table on our project website: https://vla-survey.github.io .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Access, website: https://vla-survey.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Bring the Apple, Not the Sofa: Impact of Irrelevant Context in Embodied AI Commands on VLA Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07067v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[RLinf-VLA: A Unified and Efficient Framework for VLA+RL Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06710v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the RLinf Team, focusing on the algorithm side.

| **[EmbodiedCoder: Parameterized Embodied Mobile Manipulation via Modern Coding Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06207v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives toward versatile robot intelligence.

| **[FlowVLA: Visual Chain of Thought-based Motion Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via next-frame prediction ``$v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$''. However, this paradigm attempts to predict the future frame's appearance directly, without explicitly reasoning about the underlying dynamics. \textbf{This lack of an explicit motion reasoning step} often leads to physically implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a paradigm that compels the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame. We instantiate this paradigm by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction that inherently encodes motion. By forcing the model to first follow the motion plan encoded by $f_t$, this process inherently \textbf{aligns the pre-training objective of dynamics prediction with the downstream task of action generation.} We conduct experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations. Our FlowVLA not only generates \textbf{more coherent and physically plausible visual predictions}, but also achieves state-of-the-art policy performance with \textbf{substantially improved sample efficiency}, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

| **[Verifier-free Test-Time Sampling for Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05681v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.</p></details> | 14 pages; 3 figures |
| **[MetaVLA: Unified Meta Co-training For Efficient Embodied Adaption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05580v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperVLA: Efficient Inference in Vision-Language-Action Models via Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04898v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/MasterXiong/HyperVLA</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Amortized Multi-Frame Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04246v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models (VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this, ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced training and inference times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huiwon-jang.github.io/contextvla</p></details> |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SITCOM: Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04041v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust robotic control policies remains a major challenge due to the high cost of collecting labeled data, limited generalization to unseen environments, and difficulties in planning over long horizons. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs (SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using trained dynamics model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE). *Equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIBERO-PRO: Towards Robust and Fair Evaluation of Vision-Language-Action Models Beyond Memorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03827v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Zxy-MLlab/LIBERO-PRO.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOTE: Vision-Language-Action Optimization with Trajectory Ensemble Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05116v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myungkyukoo.github.io/hamlet/</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe/</p></details> |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.</p></details> |  |

Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

| **[Hybrid Training for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00600v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a. Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

| **[MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

It leverages semantic map abstractions to unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations, as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline: learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful trajectories.</p></details> |  |

To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system. Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

This work mitigates these challenges by introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process. Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning, and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception, language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark, it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate, consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.</p></details> | technique report |

Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models.

Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

However, such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently, their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA, a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in the demonstrations.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysiAgent: An Embodied Agent Framework in Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24524v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid, sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce the multi-robot, multi-objective, and multi-mode routing and scheduling (M3RS) problem, designed for time-constrained missions. In M3RS, each task offers multiple execution modes with varying resource needs, durations, and quality levels, allowing trade-offs across mission objectives. M3RS is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem and optimizes task sequencing and execution modes for each agent. We apply M3RS to multi-robot disinfection in healthcare and public spaces, optimizing disinfection quality and task completion rates. Through synthetic case studies, M3RS demonstrates 3-46$\%$ performance improvements over the standard task allocation method across various metrics. Further, to improve compute time, we propose a clustering-based column generation algorithm that achieves solutions comparable to or better than the baseline MIP solver while reducing computation time by 60$\%$. We also conduct case studies with simulated and real robots.

| **[Interleave-VLA: Enhancing Robot Manipulation with Interleaved Image-Text Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02152v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models paves the way for generalist robot policies in the physical world. Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

Eight artists engaged in six painting sessions -- three with a human partner, followed by three with the robot -- and subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Human-human interactions were described as intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging, whereas human-robot sessions felt more playful and reflective, offering greater autonomy and prompting for novel strategies to overcome the system's limitations.

| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

Kirigami structures, characterized by their bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through various energy sources, while kirigami sensors bridge the gap between electrical conductivity and compliance. Kirigami-integrated batteries enable energy storage directly within robot structures, enhancing flexibility and compactness. Kirigami-controlled mechanisms mimic mechanical computations, enabling advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and memory functions. Applications of kirigami-enabled robots include grasping, locomotion, and wearables, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments and tasks.

| **[Touch Speaks, Sound Feels: A Multimodal Approach to Affective and Social Touch from Robots to Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07839v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human communication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced in isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only perceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying auditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory information forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While extensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial expressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and emotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we developed a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25 vibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver combined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese participants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through vibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on arousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined haptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to single modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively supported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on the emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient for conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the importance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and highlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing emotional communication.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8% without platform-specific tuning.

Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

| **[Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Differential Actuation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recently released humanoid robots, inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, employ actuator configurations in which the motors are displaced from the joints to reduce leg inertia. While studies accounting for the full kinematic complexity have demonstrated the benefits of these designs, the associated loop-closure constraints greatly increase computational cost and limit their use in control and learning. As a result, the non-linear transmission is often approximated by a constant reduction ratio, preventing exploitation of the mechanism's full capabilities. This paper introduces a compact analytical formulation for the two standard knee and ankle mechanisms that captures the exact non-linear transmission while remaining computationally efficient. The model is fully differentiable up to second order with a minimal formulation, enabling low-cost evaluation of dynamic derivatives for trajectory optimization and of the apparent transmission impedance for reinforcement learning. We integrate this formulation into trajectory optimization and locomotion policy learning, and compare it against simplified constant-ratio approaches. Hardware experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness, showing that the proposed method provides a practical means to incorporate parallel actuation into modern control algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However, existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders, to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence. We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability, comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support, and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic care.</p></details> |  |

Although classical navigation methods provide interpretability, they rely heavily on expert manual tuning, limiting their adaptability. Conversely, purely learning-based methods offer adaptability but often lead to instability and erratic robot behaviors. Recently introduced parameter tuners aim to balance these approaches by integrating data-driven adaptability into classical navigation frameworks. However, the parameter tuning process currently suffers from training inefficiencies and redundant sampling, with critical regions in environment often underrepresented in training data. In this paper, we propose EffiTune, a novel framework designed to diagnose and mitigate training inefficiency for parameter tuners in robot navigation systems. EffiTune first performs robot-behavior-guided diagnostics to pinpoint critical bottlenecks and underrepresented regions. It then employs a targeted up-sampling strategy to enrich the training dataset with critical samples, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing training efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that EffiTune achieves more than a 13.5% improvement in navigation performance, enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a 4x improvement in training efficiency within the same computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

These materials pose a unique problem for traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor.

We explore this question through a playful and poetic experiential dinner theater: a tangible design fiction staged as a 2052 Paris restaurant where diners consume a biohybrid flying robot in place of the banned delicacy of ortolan bunting. Moving beyond textual or visual speculation, our ``dinner-in-the-drama'' combined performance, ritual, and multisensory immersion to provoke reflection on sustainability, ethics, and cultural identity. Six participants from creative industries engaged as diners and role-players, responding with curiosity, discomfort, and philosophical debate. They imagined biohybrids as both plausible and unsettling -- raising questions of sentience, symbolism, and technology adoption that exceed conventional sustainability framings of synthetic meat. Our contributions to HCI are threefold: (i) a speculative artifact that stages robots as food, (ii) empirical insights into how publics negotiate cultural and ethical boundaries in post-natural eating, and (iii) a methodological advance in embodied, multisensory design fiction.</p></details> |  |
| **[DYMO-Hair: Generalizable Volumetric Dynamics Modeling for Robot Hair Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06199v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines 3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.</p></details> |  |

Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation. Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment (TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical robotic wound care automation.</p></details> |  |

For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages the Clarke transform, the Euler-Lagrange formalism, and the piecewise constant curvature assumption to formulate a dynamic model on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in the joint space that inherently satisfies tendon constraints. We present linear and constraint-informed controllers that operate directly on this manifold, along with practical methods for preventing negative tendon forces without compromising control fidelity. This opens up new design possibilities for overactuated TDCRs with improved force distribution and stiffness without increasing controller complexity. We validate these approaches in simulation and on a physical prototype with one segment and five tendons, demonstrating accurate dynamic behavior and robust trajectory tracking under real-time conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025), 8 pages, and 8 figures</p></details> |

Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated 1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and constructing accurate 2D maps.</p></details> |  |

Using a preinstalled two-layer nonlinear control scheme that decouples linear and angular velocities and regulates heading, a third, delay-dependent layer that achieves exact model matching from the orientation angle command to the orientation angle is introduced. The proposed outer loop controller is a delay dependent dynamic measurable output-feedback controller with dynamic proper precompensator. Parameterization yields a simple characteristic quasi-polynomial with coefficients constrained to satisfy stability for all delays up to a computable bound. Computational experiments confirm accurate tracking, fast settling and bounded internal signals and control voltages. The approach offers an analytic design alternative to AI-based tuning for delayed robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Traditional supervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training and often fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can be guided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Few-Shot Adaptation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07135v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

While such models can answer directly from images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes, which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables. However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.</p></details> |  |

By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |

However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment.

| **[Unified Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Matching Cost Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03363v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based (pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB-3D and RGB-Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision-language models. Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample, mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB-3D, RGB-Text) UAD scenarios.

This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution.

Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[TTRV: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06783v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Rank, Reduced Forgetting: Knowledge Retention in Continual Learning Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01004v6)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to accumulate knowledge from sequential tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Vision-language models such as CLIP, with strong generalization, are widely used for CL. Existing methods often adapt isolated PTM components, increasing inference complexity and limiting model improvement, or rely on replay, stored data, or assumptions, leading to high costs and limited applicability. To advance models as continual learners, we explore CL through natural and efficient PTM updates rather than complex task-specific additions. We study continual low-rank learning and analyze how LoRA ranks and placements affect learning and forgetting. A higher-rank LoRA improves task learning (plasticity) but increases forgetting, while a lower-rank LoRA enhances stability but limits adaptation. We observe a plasticity-stability balance tied to rank across parameters and tasks, with moderately small ranks maximizing CL benefits. Motivated by this, we propose Continual Dynamic Rank-Selective LoRA (CoDyRA), which continually updates PTMs with LoRA adapters of adaptively optimized ranks. The new-task objective drives learning, while sparsity-promoting regularization minimizes ranks to reduce interference and forgetting, achieving a balance tailored to each parameter and task. Although all parameters are updated, the minimized ranks keep the model close to its prior state while enabling effective new-task learning. CoDyRA performs efficient CL as a sequence of LoRA-based updates without storing past data or relying on assumptions, preserving the original model architecture and adding no inference overhead. Experiments show CoDyRA improves new representations while retaining old knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.

While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoPE: Hybrid of Position Embedding for Long Context Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20444v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long contexts, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/HoPE.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[VUGEN: Visual Understanding priors for GENeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06529v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally, a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space. We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning under Vision: Understanding Visual-Spatial Cognition in Vision-Language Models for CAPTCHA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06067v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |

We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments, with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.</p></details> | IEEE CAI 2025 |
| **[Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19252v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables the generation of photorealistic videos, although the content of these generated videos often includes unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025.

| **[AgriGPT-VL: Agricultural Vision-Language Understanding Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04002v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Factory with Minimal Human Effort Using VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05722v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[Adapting Large Language Models to Mitigate Skin Tone Biases in Clinical Dermatology Tasks: A Mixed-Methods Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00055v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema, allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset. We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from 300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity, physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones. SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1, precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI, indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing backbones for custom skin disease classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EADV (European Academy of Dermatology) and SID (Society for Investigative Dermatology)</p></details> |

| **[Activation-Informed Pareto-Guided Low-Rank Compression for Efficient LLM/VLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05544v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and inference speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models for Image Quality Assessment via Voting and Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25787v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present an evaluation protocol for healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance, and patient trust.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMPACT: Intelligent Motion Planning with Acceptable Contact Trajectories via Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10110v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it difficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3200 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

| **[Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05038v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval.

| **[Efficient Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04991v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms, corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter paths on average.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Pragmatic Embodied Spoken Instruction Following in Human-Robot Collaboration with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10849v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken language instructions are ubiquitous in agent collaboration. However, in real-world human-robot collaboration, following human spoken instructions can be challenging due to various speaker and environmental factors, such as background noise or mispronunciation. When faced with noisy auditory inputs, humans can leverage the collaborative context in the embodied environment to interpret noisy spoken instructions and take pragmatic assistive actions. In this paper, we present a cognitively inspired neurosymbolic model, Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), which leverages a Vision-Language Model with model-based mental inference to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions. We test SIFToM in both simulated environments (VirtualHome) and real-world human-robot collaborative settings with human evaluations. Results show that SIFToM can significantly improve the performance of a lightweight base VLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and approaching human-level accuracy on challenging spoken instruction following tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Tale of Two Experts: Cooperative Learning for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22229v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that (1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2) separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3) enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main, 28 pages, 11 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12266v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In particular, seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model outputs. While multimodal safety has received increasing attention, existing approaches often fail to address such latent risks, especially when harmfulness arises only from the interaction between modalities. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free, intent-aware safety framework that proactively detects harmful intent in multimodal inputs and uses it to guide the generation of safe responses. SIA follows a three-stage process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning; (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; and (3) intent-conditioned response generation. By dynamically adapting to the implicit intent inferred from an image-text pair, SIA mitigates harmful outputs without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments on safety benchmarks, including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, show that SIA consistently improves safety and outperforms prior training-free methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems(SafeMM-AI) Workshop at ICCV2025, Non-archival track</p></details> |

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are replaced by textual descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Representation Learning for Customized Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04564v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-NeurIPS-CRL.</p></details> |  |

Uncovering the Reasoning-Planning Disconnect in Training Vision-Language Driving Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04532v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan. Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately, indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel, training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the causal fidelity of future models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset will be released publicly once the paper is accepted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14715v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

However, current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive, Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other VLM-based techniques.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

An Urban Perception Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.</p></details> |  |

Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

Recent work has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask: when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator preventing a pot of wax from overheating.</p></details> | 8 tables 6 figures |

Despite the growing interest in developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide future research in a more meaningful direction.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Unlike previous research that focuses on either communication or coordination separately, our approach achieves both simultaneously. Our method integrates world models with communication channels, enabling agents to predict environmental dynamics, estimate states from partial observations, and share critical information through bidirectional message exchange with contrastive learning for message alignment. Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our communication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents have divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination after centralized models. Importantly, our decentralized approach with constraints preventing direct access to other agents' internal states facilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately reflect environmental states. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of decentralized communication for supporting coordination while developing shared representations of the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICDL 2025</p></details> |

In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm attempts to predict the future frame's appearance directly, without explicitly reasoning about the underlying dynamics. \textbf{This lack of an explicit motion reasoning step} often leads to physically implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a paradigm that compels the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame. We instantiate this paradigm by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction that inherently encodes motion. By forcing the model to first follow the motion plan encoded by $f_t$, this process inherently \textbf{aligns the pre-training objective of dynamics prediction with the downstream task of action generation.} We conduct experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations. Our FlowVLA not only generates \textbf{more coherent and physically plausible visual predictions}, but also achieves state-of-the-art policy performance with \textbf{substantially improved sample efficiency}, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

| **[StaMo: Unsupervised Learning of Generalizable Robot Motion from Compact State Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05057v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making. However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Perception, Reasoning, Modeling and Interaction: A Survey on Physical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04978v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states, advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems.

| **[Code World Models for General Game Playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04542v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach -- involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions (to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability: The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules, allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10 considered games.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LLMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. Conceptually, SymPlanner operationalizes two cognitive faculties: (i) error monitoring and repair via externalized feedback (IC) and (ii) preference formation among alternatives via pairwise comparison (CR), advancing cognitively plausible, symbol-grounded planning aligned with the rich structure in intelligent systems. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Twelfth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems</p></details> |
| **[Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

While recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are constrained to 2D views and offer limited interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that generates 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces dynamic environments where objects can be directed, recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits to be applied interactively without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high scene fidelity while enabling controllability and editability. The code is available at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Morph4D.</p></details> |  |
| **[A "Good" Regulator May Provide a World Model for Intelligent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23032v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One classic idea from the cybernetics literature is the Every Good Regulator Theorem (EGRT). The EGRT provides a means to identify good regulation, or the conditions under which an agent (regulator) can match the dynamical behavior of a system. We reevaluate and recast the EGRT in a modern context to provide insight into how intelligent autonomous learning systems might utilize a compressed global representation (world model). One-to-one mappings between a regulator (R) and the corresponding system (S) provide a reduced representation that preserves useful variety to match all possible outcomes of a system. The EGRT also extends to second-order cybernetics, where an internal model (M) observes the behavior of S and supervises a S-R closed loop mapping. Secondarily, we demonstrate how physical phenomena such as temporal criticality, non-normal denoising, and alternating procedural acquisition can recast behavior as statistical mechanics and yield regulatory relationships. These diverse physical systems challenge the notion of tightly-coupled good regulation when applied to non-uniform and out-of-distribution phenomena. Overall, we aim to recast the EGRT as a potential approach for developing world models that adapt and respond to a wide range of task environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 5 figures, 3 supplemental Figures, 3 supplemental tables</p></details> |
| **[GDPval: Evaluating AI Model Performance on Real-World Economically Valuable Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04374v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GDPval, a benchmark evaluating AI model capabilities on real-world economically valuable tasks. GDPval covers the majority of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Activities for 44 occupations across the top 9 sectors contributing to U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Tasks are constructed from the representative work of industry professionals with an average of 14 years of experience. We find that frontier model performance on GDPval is improving roughly linearly over time, and that the current best frontier models are approaching industry experts in deliverable quality. We analyze the potential for frontier models, when paired with human oversight, to perform GDPval tasks cheaper and faster than unaided experts. We also demonstrate that increased reasoning effort, increased task context, and increased scaffolding improves model performance on GDPval. Finally, we open-source a gold subset of 220 tasks and provide a public automated grading service at evals.openai.com to facilitate future research in understanding real-world model capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach with Generative World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04020v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the dual challenges of inherent stochasticity and non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP), a new paradigm grounded in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.</p></details> |  |
