| **[Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10912v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASCD: Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding for Reducing Hallucination in MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14766v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) often suffer from hallucinations. They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Exploring MLLMs Perception of Network Visualization Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14611v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we test whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can match human-subject performance in tasks involving the perception of properties in network layouts. Specifically, we replicate a human-subject experiment about perceiving quality (namely stress) in network layouts using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception. Explanations from the models provide descriptions similar to those used by the human participants (e.g., even distribution of nodes and uniform edge lengths).</p></details> |  |
| **[PunchBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Multimodal Punchline Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11906v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal punchlines, which involve humor or sarcasm conveyed in image-caption pairs, are a popular way of communication on online multimedia platforms. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the camera-ready version for ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LingoLoop Attack: Trapping MLLMs via Linguistic Context and State Entrapment into Endless Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14493v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise but require substantial computational resources during inference. Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment. The code will be released publicly following the paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOP: Learning Optimal Pruning for Efficient On-Demand MLLMs Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12826v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose LOP, an efficient neural pruning framework that learns optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Will Pre-Training Ever End? A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v6)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time computation and post-training optimization, largely due to concerns over the availability of high-quality human data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient to drive substantial model improvements. We argue that effective model advancement requires strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time computation, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description for step-by-step visual understanding and integrate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced models then generate candidate image captions and CoT reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are filtered through a semantic-similarity-guided self-consistency mechanism. These high-quality, self-generated samples enable large-scale multimodal pre-training, creating a self-improvement loop. Experiments demonstrate SIcog's effectiveness in developing MLLMs with enhanced multimodal cognition. Using only 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog achieves significant improvements, including +3.6% on MMStar and +3.5% on AI2D, outperforming previous pre-training approaches. When combined with post-training techniques for CoT reasoning, SIcog yields +9% gains on MMVet and +8.5% on ScienceQA.</p></details> | 43 pages. Preprint |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. It serves as an essential testing ground for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work, we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex real-world vision-language tasks.

| **[Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT).

| **[Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 82 pages |
| **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, code: https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner, project page: https://theia-4869.github.io/CDPruner</p></details> |
| **[ViC-Bench: Benchmarking Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Capability in MLLMs with Free-Style Intermediate State Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14404v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AD^2-Bench: A Hierarchical CoT Benchmark for MLLM in Autonomous Driving under Adverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09557v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable and Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images via Grounded Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07045v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations. However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging MLLM Embeddings and Attribute Smoothing for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12584v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects learned from seen compositions. Previous works disentangle attributes and objects by extracting shared and exclusive parts between the image pair sharing the same attribute (object), as well as aligning them with pretrained word embeddings to improve unseen attribute-object recognition. Despite the significant achievements of existing efforts, they are hampered by three limitations: (1) The efficacy of disentanglement is compromised due to the influence of the background and the intricate entanglement of attributes with objects in the same parts. (2) Existing word embeddings fail to capture complex multimodal semantic information. (3) Overconfidence exhibited by existing models in seen compositions hinders their generalization to novel compositions. Being aware of these, we propose a novel framework named multimodal large language model (MLLM) embeddings and attribute smoothing guided disentanglement for CZSL. First, we leverage feature adaptive aggregation modules to mitigate the impact of background, and utilize learnable condition masks to capture multi-granularity features for disentanglement. Moreover, the last hidden states of MLLM are employed as word embeddings for their superior representation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose attribute smoothing with auxiliary attributes generated by the large language model (LLM) for seen compositions to address the overconfidence challenge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets.

| **[Guiding Cross-Modal Representations with MLLM Priors via Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06970v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Far and Clearly: Mitigating Hallucinations in MLLMs with Attention Causal Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16652v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Clari...</summary><p>Clarification note for the CVPR 2025 paper (FarSight).

A Benchmark Study on Fine-Grained Visual Reasoning from Transit Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18675v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Robot Safety via MLLM-Based Semantic Interpretation of Failure Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06570v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments, ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants, they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal latent patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can be employed for online failure detection, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DesignBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for MLLM-based Front-end Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06251v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues. (3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS, and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair) in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated front-end development.

| **[MATP-BENCH: Can MLLM Be a Good Automated Theorem Prover for Multimodal Problems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06034v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal, Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056 multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research on automated theorem proving.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Modality-Fair Preference Optimization for Trustworthy MLLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15334v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05344v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at https://github.com/CR400AF-A/SparseMM.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.</p></details> | 32pages |
| **[MMBoundary: Advancing MLLM Knowledge Boundary Awareness through Reasoning Step Confidence Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23224v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, ACL 2025 |
| **[MokA: Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05191v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration.

| **[Vision Remember: Alleviating Visual Forgetting in Efficient MLLM with Vision Feature Resample](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03928v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model. Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \& Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating MLLMs with Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04280v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$, including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology, from training data to reasoning mechanisms, influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains.

| **[MoDA: Modulation Adapter for Fine-Grained Visual Grounding in Instructional MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01850v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2) refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction. The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available on the following webpage to support further research in this area.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs, with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K: +4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in K12 scenarios are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method, resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring 33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable MLLMs.We open our resources at https://github.com/lichongod/K12Vista.</p></details> |  |

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Existing benchmarks fail to adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities; and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns, highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method} establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in original base models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena. We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.</p></details> |  |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

However, full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIE: MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable AIGC Image Implausibility Evaluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17261v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable Image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.

These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.</p></details> |  |

The key distinction lies in how visual tokens are processed. Decoder-only architectures apply self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens, while cross-attention architectures skip these computations. To investigate whether redundancy exists in this computationally expensive process, we propose a training-free framework for analyzing trained MLLMs. It consists of Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN and Hollow Attention, which enable adjustable reductions in computations for visual tokens, as well as a Layer Ranking Algorithm that prioritizes layers for these reductions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial, structured, and clustered redundancy unique to decoder-only MLLMs, offering valuable insights for future MLLM architecture design. Furthermore, by leveraging our reduction framework as a training-free inference acceleration approach, we achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods while remaining compatible with them.

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threading Keyframe with Narratives: MLLMs as Strong Long Video Comprehenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24158v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Employing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for long video understanding remains a challenging problem due to the dilemma between the substantial number of video frames (i.e., visual tokens) versus the limited context length of language models. Traditional uniform sampling often leads to selection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of frames imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose threading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to facilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally involves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection process as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing query-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a customized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative. Second, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe sampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from non-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted between keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and compact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware compression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities. Experimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC significantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a novel geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

We establish standardized evaluation protocols for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), and provide open source software to download relevant data, models, and evaluations. Additionally, we provide a composite dataset with over 1.3 trillion tokens of image captioning, visual question answering, commonsense reasoning, robotic control, digital game-play, simulated locomotion/manipulation, and many more tasks.

However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in procedurally out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLMs and VLAs - including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA, Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST - on diverse procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexity; (2) VLAs generally outperforms other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering. We release our benchmark, evaluation framework, and findings to enable the assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in their application to out-of-distribution digital tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 26 figures |

Yet existing approaches are constrained by their dependence on hand-crafted skills, extensive parameter tuning, or computationally intensive models unsuitable for onboard use. We introduce GRaD-Nav++, a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that runs fully onboard and follows natural-language commands in real time. Our policy is trained in a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) simulator via Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DiffRL), enabling efficient learning of low-level control from visual and linguistic inputs. At its core is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) action head, which adaptively routes computation to improve generalization while mitigating forgetting. In multi-task generalization experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings. These results establish a new benchmark for fully onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) flight and demonstrate that compact, efficient models can enable reliable, language-guided navigation without relying on external infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link:https://autovla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LeVERB: Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Latent Vision-Language Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13751v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEED-VLA: Consistency Vision-Language-Action Model with Early-Exit Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13725v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding and generalization capabilities. Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.

| **[ROSA: Harnessing Robot States for Vision-Language and Action Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13679v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel agentic modeling approach for surgeon-specific behavior prediction in robotic surgery, combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Gesture prediction is framed as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including surgical video, intent language, and personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill. These embeddings are encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

| **[RationalVLA: A Rational Vision-Language-Action Model with Dual System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10826v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is https://irpn-eai.github.io/RationalVLA.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

| **[From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09930v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.

However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

| **[Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23450v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedure (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1% and OpenVLA by 7.4% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

| **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $π_0$ using Text Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue, existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency 93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Reasoning for Perception, Explanation, and Autonomous Action in Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08462v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings. Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications. Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted deployment in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07961v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

However, its sequential autoregressive token generation introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT policies closer to practical real-time deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, their growing model size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in https://github.com/ustcwhy/BitVLA.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world, increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method, real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and "inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast, performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the presence of significant latency.

However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. Here we introduce Mask-guided feature pooling, a lightweight enhancement to existing LDRG methods. Our approach employs a two-stage training strategy: first, a vision-language model generates feature maps from CLIP-fused embeddings, which are upsampled and weighted by text embeddings to produce segmentation masks. Next, the decoder generates separate feature maps for grasp prediction, pooling only token features within these masked regions to efficiently predict grasp poses. This targeted pooling approach reduces computational complexity, accelerating both training and inference. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 12% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. By extending 2D grasp predictions to 3D via depth mapping and inverse kinematics, our modular method achieves performance comparable to recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, with improved generalization across different task suites. Real-world experiments on a 7 DoF Franka robotic arm demonstrate a 57% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 7%. Code will be released post publication.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced multi-task learning and instruction following, they typically assume static task intent, failing to respond when new instructions arrive during ongoing execution. This limitation hinders natural and robust interaction in dynamic settings, such as retail or household environments, where real-time intent changes are common. We propose SwitchVLA, a unified, execution-aware framework that enables smooth and reactive task switching without external planners or additional switch-specific data. We model task switching as a behavior modulation problem conditioned on execution state and instruction context. Expert demonstrations are segmented into temporally grounded contact phases, allowing the policy to infer task progress and adjust its behavior accordingly. A multi-behavior conditional policy is then trained to generate flexible action chunks under varying behavior modes through conditioned trajectory modeling. Experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that SwitchVLA enables robust instruction adherence, fluid task switching, and strong generalization-outperforming prior VLA baselines in both task success rate and interaction naturalness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://switchvla.github.io</p></details> |

The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast-in-Slow: A Dual-System Foundation Model Unifying Fast Manipulation within Slow Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01953v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized policy and execution efficiency constitute the two critical challenges in robotic manipulation. While recent foundation policies benefit from the common-sense reasoning capabilities of internet-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), they often suffer from low execution frequency. To mitigate this dilemma, dual-system approaches, inspired by Kahneman's theory, have been proposed to leverage a VLM-based System 2 model handling high-level reasoning and a separate System 1 action model ensuring real-time control. However, existing designs maintain both systems as separate models, limiting System 1 from fully leveraging the rich pretrained knowledge from the VLM-based System 2. In this work, we propose Fast-in-Slow (FiS), a unified dual-system vision-language-action (VLA) model that embeds the System 1 execution module within the VLM-based System 2 by partially sharing parameters. This innovative paradigm not only enables high-frequency execution in System 1 but also facilitates coordination between the reasoning and execution components within a single foundation model of System 2. Given their fundamentally distinct roles within FiS-VLA, we design the two systems to incorporate heterogeneous modality inputs alongside asynchronous operating frequencies, enabling both fast and precise manipulation. To enable coordination between the two systems, a dual-aware co-training strategy is proposed that equips System 1 with action generation capabilities while preserving System 2's contextual reasoning representation. For evaluation, FiS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 8% in simulation and 11% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, while achieving a 117.7 Hz control frequency with action chunk set to eight.

Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code, pretrained models, and training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages.

However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.</p></details> |  |

Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |

This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p></details> |  |

We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, these models pose extreme safety challenges during real-world deployment, including the risk of harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety constraints be explicitly integrated into VLAs? We address this by exploring an integrated safety approach (ISA), systematically modeling safety requirements, then actively eliciting diverse unsafe behaviors, effectively constraining VLA policies via safe reinforcement learning, and rigorously assuring their safety through targeted evaluations. Leveraging the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) paradigm, ISA optimizes VLAs from a min-max perspective against elicited safety risks. Thus, policies aligned through this comprehensive approach achieve the following key features: (I) effective safety-performance trade-offs, this exploration yields an 83.58% safety improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art method, while also maintaining task performance (+3.85%). (II) strong safety assurance, with the ability to mitigate long-tail risks and handle extreme failure scenarios. (III) robust generalization of learned safety behaviors to various out-of-distribution perturbations. Our data, models and newly proposed benchmark environment are available at https://pku-safevla.github.io.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[LoHoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00411v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions. Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e., decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e., generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA) models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning for Efficient Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15304v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network (DNN)-based policy models, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models, excel at automating complex decision-making from multi-modal inputs. However, scaling these models greatly increases computational overhead, complicating deployment in resource-constrained settings like robot manipulation and autonomous driving. To address this, we propose Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning (SQIL), which combines quantization-aware training with a selective loss-weighting strategy for mission-critical states. By identifying these states via saliency scores and emphasizing them in the training loss, SQIL preserves decision fidelity under low-bit precision. We validate SQIL's generalization capability across extensive simulation benchmarks with environment variations, real-world tasks, and cross-domain tasks (self-driving, physics simulation), consistently recovering full-precision performance. Notably, a 4-bit weight-quantized VLA model for robotic manipulation achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings on an edge GPU with minimal accuracy loss. These results underline SQIL's potential for efficiently deploying large IL-based policy models on resource-limited devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.01034</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Generalizable Bimanual Foundation Policy via Flow-based Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24156v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot, and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks. We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize, be capable of solving math problems, and possess visual-spatial intelligence, 2) Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized two-stage training pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities, despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a substantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic foundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://chatvla-2.github.io/</p></details> |

This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented question-answering annotations and action trajectories.

Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception, prediction, and planning.

| **[Knowledge Insulating Vision-Language-Action Models: Train Fast, Run Fast, Generalize Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23705v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

While recent benchmarks have advanced VLA research in domestic tasks, professional science-oriented domains remain underexplored. We introduce AutoBio, a simulation framework and benchmark designed to evaluate robotic automation in biology laboratory environments--an application domain that combines structured protocols with demanding precision and multimodal interaction. AutoBio extends existing simulation capabilities through a pipeline for digitizing real-world laboratory instruments, specialized physics plugins for mechanisms ubiquitous in laboratory workflows, and a rendering stack that support dynamic instrument interfaces and transparent materials through physically based rendering. Our benchmark comprises biologically grounded tasks spanning three difficulty levels, enabling standardized evaluation of language-guided robotic manipulation in experimental protocols. We provide infrastructure for demonstration generation and seamless integration with VLA models. Baseline evaluations with two SOTA VLA models reveal significant gaps in precision manipulation, visual reasoning, and instruction following in scientific workflows. By releasing AutoBio, we aim to catalyze research on generalist robotic systems for complex, high-precision, and multimodal professional environments.

To address these challenges, we propose knowledge graph-based skill library construction method. This method hierarchically organizes manipulation knowledge using "task graph" and "scene graph" to represent task-specific and scene-specific information, respectively. Additionally, we introduce "state graph" to facilitate the interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Building upon this foundation, we further propose a novel hierarchical skill transfer framework based on the skill library and tactile representation, which integrates high-level reasoning for skill transfer and low-level precision for execution. At the task level, we utilize large language models (LLMs) and combine contextual learning with a four-stage chain-of-thought prompting paradigm to achieve subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, we develop an adaptive trajectory transfer method based on the skill library and the heuristic path planning algorithm. At the physical level, we propose an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile representation. This method dynamically acquires high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile images, adjusting parameters such as contact position and posture to ensure the effectiveness of transferred skills in new environments. Experiments demonstrate the skill transfer and adaptability capabilities of the proposed methods across different task scenarios.

This paper investigates coverage path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders, particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source while ensuring safe navigation. We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational feasibility.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages. presented in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication. Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still require accurate long-endurance localization. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity of bio-realistic networks. In order to overcome this challenge, fusion of hardware and algorithms is critical to employ this specialized computing paradigm. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs competitive place recognition in up to 8 kilometers of traversal using models as small as 180 kilobytes with 44,000 parameters, while consuming less than 8% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems (LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SynSense Speck chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. When compared to a benchmark place recognition method, Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD), LENS performs comparably in overall precision. LENS represents an accurate fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment for energy efficient robotic place recognition. Neuromorphic computing enables resource-constrained robots to perform energy efficient, accurate localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 5 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables, and 1 movie</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in language model agents, they remain prone to planning errors and limited in their ability to plan ahead. To address these limitations in robotic planning, we advocate a self-refining scheme that iteratively refines a draft plan until an equilibrium is reached. Remarkably, this process can be optimized end-to-end from an analytical perspective without the need to curate additional verifiers or reward models, allowing us to train self-refining planners in a simple supervised learning fashion. Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling procedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates useful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method is evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance with improved scaling w.r.t. inference-time computation.

Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

However, the numerous implementation details make transferring these policies to real-world robots a challenging task. To address this, we have developed a comprehensive code framework that covers the entire process from training to deployment, incorporating common RL training methods, domain randomization, reward function design, and solutions for handling parallel structures. This library is made available as a community resource, with detailed descriptions of its design and experimental results. We validate the framework on the Booster T1 robot, demonstrating that the trained policies seamlessly transfer to the physical platform, enabling capabilities such as omnidirectional walking, disturbance resistance, and terrain adaptability.

Although social robots tend to be deployed with ``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS) toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3) an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the assistant use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RO-MAN 2025, Demo at HRI 2025 : https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3721488.3721774</p></details> |

This paper presents the design, modeling, and experimentation of a novel tailless flapping-wing robot with three independently actuated pairs of wings. Inspired by the leg morphology of juvenile water striders, the robot incorporates bio-inspired elastic passive legs that convert flapping-induced vibrations into directional ground movement, enabling locomotion without additional actuators. This vibration-driven mechanism facilitates lightweight, mechanically simplified multi-modal mobility. An SE(3)-based controller coordinates flight and mode transitions with minimal actuation. To validate the robot's feasibility, a functional prototype was developed, and experiments were conducted to evaluate its flight, ground locomotion, and mode-switching capabilities. Results show satisfactory performance under constrained actuation, highlighting the potential of multi-modal flapping-wing designs for future aerial-ground robotic applications. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on frequency-based terrestrial control and passive yaw stabilization in hybrid locomotion systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

We integrate the regular Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a novel pose optimization mechanism to more efficiently mitigate disturbances (such as human behavioral uncertainties or robot actuation noise) during the task. The core of our methodology involves a two-step iterative design: At each planning horizon, we determine the optimal pose of the robotic arm (joint angle configuration) from a candidate set, aiming to achieve the lowest estimated control cost. This selection is based on solving a disturbance-aware Discrete Algebraic Ricatti Equation (DARE), which also determines the optimal inputs for the robot's whole body control (including both the mobile base and the robotic arm). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide theoretical derivation for the disturbance-aware DARE and perform simulated experiments and hardware demos using a Fetch robot under varying conditions, including different trajectories and different levels of disturbances. The results reveal that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Assigning Multi-Robot Tasks to Multitasking Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15032v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper, we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic setting.</p></details> |  |

Although advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial manipulation in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures.

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.

In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator to reliably follow waypoints while automatically estimating and compensating for unknown payload weight. Our method integrates an admittance control framework with a mass estimator, allowing the robot to dynamically update an excitation force to compensate for the payload mass. This strategy mitigates end-effector sagging and preserves stability when handling objects of unknown weights. We experimentally validated our approach in a challenging pick-and-place task on a shelf with a crossbar, improved accuracy in reaching waypoints and compliant motion compared to a baseline admittance-control scheme. By safely accommodating unknown payloads, our work enhances flexibility in robotic automation and represents a significant step forward in adaptive control for uncertain environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[RobotSmith: Generative Robotic Tool Design for Acquisition of Complex Manipulation Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14763v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endowing robots with tool design abilities is critical for enabling them to solve complex manipulation tasks that would otherwise be intractable. While recent generative frameworks can automatically synthesize task settings, such as 3D scenes and reward functions, they have not yet addressed the challenge of tool-use scenarios. Simply retrieving human-designed tools might not be ideal since many tools (e.g., a rolling pin) are difficult for robotic manipulators to handle. Furthermore, existing tool design approaches either rely on predefined templates with limited parameter tuning or apply generic 3D generation methods that are not optimized for tool creation. To address these limitations, we propose RobotSmith, an automated pipeline that leverages the implicit physical knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) alongside the more accurate physics provided by physics simulations to design and use tools for robotic manipulation. Our system (1) iteratively proposes tool designs using collaborative VLM agents, (2) generates low-level robot trajectories for tool use, and (3) jointly optimizes tool geometry and usage for task performance. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of manipulation tasks involving rigid, deformable, and fluid objects. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both task success rate and overall performance. Notably, our approach achieves a 50.0\% average success rate, significantly surpassing other baselines such as 3D generation (21.4%) and tool retrieval (11.1%). Finally, we deploy our system in real-world settings, demonstrating that the generated tools and their usage plans transfer effectively to physical execution, validating the practicality and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While current robot programming tools (such as inverse kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale car in real-world experiments.

Trained on ~1M contact-rich interactions collected with the Digit 360 sensor, Sparsh-X captures complementary touch signals at diverse temporal and spatial scales. By leveraging self-supervised learning, Sparsh-X fuses these modalities into a unified representation that captures physical properties useful for robot manipulation tasks. We study how to effectively integrate real-world touch representations for both imitation learning and tactile adaptation of sim-trained policies, showing that Sparsh-X boosts policy success rates by 63% over an end-to-end model using tactile images and improves robustness by 90% in recovering object states from touch. Finally, we benchmark Sparsh-X ability to make inferences about physical properties, such as object-action identification, material-quantity estimation, and force estimation. Sparsh-X improves accuracy in characterizing physical properties by 48% compared to end-to-end approaches, demonstrating the advantages of multisensory pretraining for capturing features essential for dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for presentation at LM4Plan@AAAI'25.

This limitation significantly affects depth map and point cloud-reliant applications, especially in robotic manipulation. We developed a vision transformer-based algorithm for stereo depth recovery of transparent objects. This approach is complemented by an innovative feature post-fusion module, which enhances the accuracy of depth recovery by structural features in images. To address the high costs associated with dataset collection for stereo camera-based perception of transparent objects, our method incorporates a parameter-aligned, domain-adaptive, and physically realistic Sim2Real simulation for efficient data generation, accelerated by AI algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's exceptional Sim2Real generalizability in real-world scenarios, enabling precise depth mapping of transparent objects to assist in robotic manipulation.

As biohazard complexity increases, minimizing direct human exposure while maintaining precision becomes essential. We propose GAMORA (Gesture Articulated Meta Operative Robotic Arm), a novel VR-guided robotic system that enables remote execution of hazardous tasks using natural hand gestures. Unlike existing scripted automation or traditional teleoperation, GAMORA integrates the Oculus Quest 2, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Robot Operating System (ROS) to provide real-time immersive control, digital twin simulation, and inverse kinematics-based articulation. The system supports VR-based training and simulation while executing precision tasks in physical environments via a 3D-printed robotic arm. Inverse kinematics ensure accurate manipulation for delicate operations such as specimen handling and pipetting. The pipeline includes Unity-based 3D environment construction, real-time motion planning, and hardware-in-the-loop testing. GAMORA achieved a mean positional discrepancy of 2.2 mm (improved from 4 mm), pipetting accuracy within 0.2 mL, and repeatability of 1.2 mm across 50 trials. Integrated object detection via YOLOv8 enhances spatial awareness, while energy-efficient operation (50% reduced power output) ensures sustainable deployment. The system's digital-physical feedback loop enables safe, precise, and repeatable automation of high-risk lab tasks. GAMORA offers a scalable, immersive solution for robotic control and biosafety in biomedical research environments.</p></details> |  |

While many approaches integrate pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation architectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained embeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning or specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this question by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen vision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged expert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to language-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though requiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that pretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle with long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical baseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using foundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering critical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs between system complexity and performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

This requires intelligent strategies to plan a robot's motions, considering both task constraints and human-specific factors such as height and movement preferences. This work introduces a novel approach to generate personalized trajectories using Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), enhanced with real-time velocity scaling based on human feedback. The method was rigorously tested in industrial-grade experiments, focusing on the collaborative transport of an engine cowl lip section. Comparative analysis between DMP-generated trajectories and a state-of-the-art motion planner (BiTRRT) highlights their adaptability combined with velocity scaling. Subjective user feedback further demonstrates a clear preference for DMP- based interactions. Objective evaluations, including physiological measurements from brain and skin activity, reinforce these findings, showcasing the advantages of DMPs in enhancing human-robot interaction and improving user experience.</p></details> |  |

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.</p></details> | under review |

However, many existing approaches emphasize safety or efficiency while overlooking social awareness. This article proposes Learning-Risk Model Predictive Control (LR-MPC), a data-driven navigation algorithm that balances efficiency, safety, and social awareness. LR-MPC consists of two phases: an offline risk learning phase, where a Probabilistic Ensemble Neural Network (PENN) is trained using risk data from a heuristic MPC-based baseline (HR-MPC), and an online adaptive inference phase, where local waypoints are sampled and globally guided by a Multi-RRT planner. Each candidate waypoint is evaluated for risk by PENN, and predictions are filtered using epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to ensure robust decision-making. The safest waypoint is selected as the MPC input for real-time navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LR-MPC outperforms baseline methods in success rate and social awareness, enabling robots to navigate complex crowds with high adaptability and low disruption.

These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for enforcing time-varying constraints often overlook model uncertainties. To address this issue, this paper proposes a CBFs-based robust adaptive controller design endowing time-varying constraints while considering parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. To this end, we first leverage Robust adaptive Control Barrier Functions (RaCBFs) to handle model uncertainty, along with the concept of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to ensure robustness towards input disturbances. Furthermore, to alleviate the inherent conservatism in robustness, we also incorporate a set membership identification scheme. We demonstrate the proposed method on robotic surface treatment that requires time-varying force bounds to ensure uniform quality, in numerical simulation and real robotic setup, showing that the quality is formally guaranteed within an acceptable range.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to ECC 2025</p></details> |

The inability to deliver information promptly can result in estimation errors that impact collaborative efforts among robots. In this paper, we propose a new metric termed Loss of Information Utility (LoIU) to quantify the freshness and utility of information critical for cooperation. The metric enables robots to prioritize information transmissions within bandwidth constraints. We also propose the estimation of LoIU using belief distributions and accordingly optimize both transmission schedule and resource allocation strategy for device-to-device transmissions to minimize the time-average LoIU within a robot team. A semi-decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework is developed, where each robot functions as an actor responsible for scheduling transmissions among its collaborators while a central critic periodically evaluates and refines the actors in response to mobility and interference. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an enhancement of information freshness and utility by 98%, compared to alternative methods.</p></details> |  |

Within these complex vascular scenarios, the accurate and reliable perception of the pose state for interventional robots is particularly crucial. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach without the need of additional sensors or markers. The core of this paper's method consists of a three-part framework: firstly, a dual-head multitask U-Net model for simultaneous vessel segment and interventional robot detection; secondly, an advanced algorithm for skeleton extraction and optimization; and finally, a comprehensive pose state perception system based on geometric features is implemented to accurately identify the robot's pose state and provide strategies for subsequent control.

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models.

Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dvnamic World Model for Robotic Mlanipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate action inference is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional methods, such as passwords and static biometrics, are vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks, particularly in high-stakes, continuous interactions. This paper presents a novel anti-spoofing and anti-replay authentication approach that leverages distinctive user behavioral features extracted from haptic feedback during human-robot interactions. To evaluate our authentication approach, we collected a time-series force feedback dataset from 15 participants performing seven distinct tasks. We then developed a transformer-based deep learning model to extract temporal features from the haptic signals. By analyzing user-specific force dynamics, our method achieves over 90 percent accuracy in both user identification and task classification, demonstrating its potential for enhancing access control and identity assurance in tele-robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Using strawberry harvesting as a case study, we present an end-to-end framework for effective object detection, segmentation, and grasp planning to tackle this issue caused by partially occluded objects. Our strategy begins with point cloud denoising and segmentation to accurately locate fruits. To compensate for incomplete scans due to occlusion, we apply a point cloud completion model to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the strawberries. The target selection focuses on ripe strawberries while categorizing others as obstacles, followed by converting the refined point cloud into an occupancy map for collision-aware motion planning. Our experimental results demonstrate high shape reconstruction accuracy, with the lowest Chamfer Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods with 1.10 mm, and significantly improved grasp success rates of 79.17%, yielding an overall success-to-attempt ratio of 89.58\% in real-world strawberry harvesting. Additionally, our method reduces the obstacle hit rate from 43.33% to 13.95%, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both grasp quality and safety compared to prior approaches. This pipeline substantially improves autonomous strawberry harvesting, advancing more efficient and reliable robotic fruit picking systems.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by these natural phenomena, we present a novel acoustic robotic system for the transport of contactless objects in mid-air. Our system leverages phased ultrasonic transducers and a robotic control system onboard to generate localized acoustic pressure fields, enabling precise manipulation of airborne particles and robots. We categorize contactless object-transport strategies into independent transport (uncoordinated) and forward-facing cooperative transport (coordinated), drawing parallels with biological systems to optimize efficiency and robustness. The proposed system is experimentally validated by evaluating levitation stability using a microphone in the measurement lab, transport efficiency through a phase-space motion capture system, and clock synchronization accuracy via an oscilloscope. The results demonstrate the feasibility of both independent and cooperative airborne object transport. This research contributes to the field of acoustophoretic robotics, with potential applications in contactless material handling, micro-assembly, and biomedical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025) as oral presentation, 8 pages with 8 figures</p></details> |

This process is defined as a multimodal classification task. However, gathering a large-scale dataset encompassing both visual and linguistic elements for model training is challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel framework focusing on data augmentation in robotic assistance scenarios, encompassing both dialogues and related environmental imagery. This approach involves leveraging a sophisticated large language model to simulate potential conversations and environmental contexts, followed by the use of a stable diffusion model to create images depicting these environments. The additionally generated data serves to refine the latest multimodal models, enabling them to more accurately determine appropriate actions in response to user interactions with the limited target data. Our experimental results, based on a dataset collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the robot's action selection capabilities, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>IWSDS...</summary><p>IWSDS 2024 Best Paper Award</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in training general-purpose robot manipulation policies guided by language instructions, there is a notable lack of large-scale datasets for fine-grained manipulation tasks with part-level instructions and diverse 3D object instances annotated with part-level labels. In this work, we introduce PartInstruct, the first large-scale benchmark for training and evaluating fine-grained robot manipulation models using part-level instructions. PartInstruct comprises 513 object instances across 14 categories, each annotated with part-level information, and 1302 fine-grained manipulation tasks organized into 16 task classes. Our training set consists of over 10,000 expert demonstrations synthesized in a 3D simulator, where each demonstration is paired with a high-level task instruction, a chain of base part-based skill instructions, and ground-truth 3D information about the object and its parts. Additionally, we designed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the generalizability of learned policies across new states, objects, and tasks. We evaluated several state-of-the-art robot manipulation approaches, including end-to-end vision-language policy learning and bi-level planning models for robot manipulation on our benchmark. The experimental results reveal that current models struggle to robustly ground part concepts and predict actions in 3D space, and face challenges when manipulating object parts in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

A critical aspect in this context is the concept of personal space, a psychological boundary around an individual that influences their comfort based on proximity. This concept extends to human-robot interaction, where robots must respect personal space to avoid causing discomfort. While much research has focused on modeling personal space in two dimensions, almost none have considered the vertical dimension. In this work, we propose a novel three-dimensional personal space model that integrates both height (introducing a discomfort function along the Z-axis) and horizontal proximity (via a classic XY-plane formulation) to quantify discomfort. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compute discomfort in 3D space at any robot component's position, considering the person's configuration and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN)</p></details> |

Drawing on a range of empirical studies and practical deployments, this paper outlines six key insights that highlight both the opportunities and challenges in using robots to promote mental wellbeing. These include (1) the lack of a single, objective measure of wellbeing, (2) the fact that robots don't need to act as companions to be effective, (3) the growing potential of virtual interactions, (4) the importance of involving clinicians in the design process, (5) the difference between one-off and long-term interactions, and (6) the idea that adaptation and personalization are not always necessary for positive outcomes. Rather than positioning robots as replacements for human therapists, we argue that they are best understood as supportive tools that must be designed with care, grounded in evidence, and shaped by ethical and psychological considerations. Our aim is to inform future research and guide responsible, effective use of robots in mental health and wellbeing contexts.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in haptic-guided teleoperation have shown promise, they are often limited to simplified tasks involving 6- or 7-DoF manipulators and rely on separate control strategies for navigation and manipulation. This increases both cognitive load and operational overhead. In this paper, we present a unified tele-mobile manipulation framework that leverages haptic-guided shared control. The system integrates a 9-DoF follower mobile manipulator and a 7-DoF leader robotic arm, enabling seamless transitions between tele-navigation and tele-manipulation through real-time haptic feedback. A user study with 20 participants under real-world conditions demonstrates that our framework significantly improves task accuracy and efficiency without increasing cognitive load. These findings highlight the potential of haptic-guided shared control for enhancing operator performance in demanding teleoperation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> |

A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |

The partial observability caused by the sensing constraints is particularly challenging. As an example, in a situation where the agents have no visibility of each other, they would need to extract information from their sensor coverage history to reason about potential locations of their opponents. However, keeping historical information greatly increases the size of the state space. To mitigate the challenges encountered with such partially observable problems, we develop a new learning-based method that encodes historical information to a belief state and uses it to generate agent actions. Through experiments we show that the learned strategies improve over existing multi-agent RL baselines by up to 16 % in terms of capture rate for the pursuer. Additionally, we present experimental results showing that learned belief states are strong state estimators for extending existing game theory solvers and demonstrate our method's competitiveness for problems where existing fully observable game theory solvers are computationally feasible. Finally, we deploy the learned policies on physical robots for a game between the F1TENTH and JetRacer platforms moving as fast as $\textbf{2 m/s}$ in indoor environments, showing that they can be executed on real-robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025) as oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[What Matters in Learning from Large-Scale Datasets for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13536v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Diffusion for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14608v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end learning approaches offer great potential for robotic manipulation, but their impact is constrained by data scarcity and heterogeneity across different embodiments. In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 13% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a novel geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Most common steering approaches, like goal-conditioning, require training the robot policy with a distribution of test-time objectives in mind. To overcome this limitation, we present DynaGuide, a steering method for diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the diffusion denoising process. DynaGuide separates the dynamics model from the base policy, which gives it multiple advantages, including the ability to steer towards multiple objectives, enhance underrepresented base policy behaviors, and maintain robustness on low-quality objectives. The separate guidance signal also allows DynaGuide to work with off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion policies. We demonstrate the performance and features of DynaGuide against other steering approaches in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing an average steering success of 70% on a set of articulated CALVIN tasks and outperforming goal-conditioning by 5.4x when steered with low-quality objectives. We also successfully steer an off-the-shelf real robot policy to express preference for particular objects and even create novel behavior.

| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13111v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

| **[Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12678v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |

Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text, 20 pages all included</p></details> |
| **[DemoSpeedup: Accelerating Visuomotor Policies via Entropy-Guided Demonstration Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05064v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand, robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable, high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and ease of adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Perception and Action: Spatially-Grounded Mid-Level Representations for Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06196v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11% higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more granular, actionable representations.

However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RA-L with IROS presentation option (2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11612v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with a Gaussian policy has become a mainstream implementation for realizing the Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) objective, which incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration and enhance policy robustness. While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .</p></details> |  |
| **[Mini Diffuser: Fast Multi-task Diffusion Policy Training Using Two-level Mini-batches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method that reduces, by an order of magnitude, the time and memory needed to train multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: In image generation, the target is high-dimensional. By contrast, in action generation, the dimensionality of the target is comparatively small, and only the image condition is high-dimensional. Our approach, \emph{Mini Diffuser}, exploits this asymmetry by introducing \emph{two-level minibatching}, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rodrigues Network for Learning Robot Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02618v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.</p></details> | 4pages |
| **[3D Equivariant Visuomotor Policy Learning via Spherical Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16969v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant models have recently been shown to improve the data efficiency of diffusion policy by a significant margin. However, prior work that explored this direction focused primarily on point cloud inputs generated by multiple cameras fixed in the workspace. This type of point cloud input is not compatible with the now-common setting where the primary input modality is an eye-in-hand RGB camera like a GoPro. This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in SO(3) without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Our work is the first SO(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for robotic manipulation that works using only monocular RGB inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[WoMAP: World Models For Embodied Open-Vocabulary Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01600v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments. However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Falcon: Fast Visuomotor Policies via Partial Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00339v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies are widely adopted in complex visuomotor tasks for their ability to capture multimodal action distributions. However, the multiple sampling steps required for action generation significantly harm real-time inference efficiency, which limits their applicability in real-time decision-making scenarios. Existing acceleration techniques either require retraining or degrade performance under low sampling steps. Here we propose Falcon, which mitigates this speed-performance trade-off and achieves further acceleration. The core insight is that visuomotor tasks exhibit sequential dependencies between actions. Falcon leverages this by reusing partially denoised actions from historical information rather than sampling from Gaussian noise at each step. By integrating current observations, Falcon reduces sampling steps while preserving performance. Importantly, Falcon is a training-free algorithm that can be applied as a plug-in to further improve decision efficiency on top of existing acceleration techniques. We validated Falcon in 48 simulated environments and 2 real-world robot experiments. demonstrating a 2-7x speedup with negligible performance degradation, offering a promising direction for efficient visuomotor policy design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Generalizable Bimanual Foundation Policy via Flow-based Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24156v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot, and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced DACER Algorithm with High Diffusion Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23426v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step. Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy. To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to DACER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior-Regularized Diffusion Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04778v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior regularization, which constrains the policy to stay close to some behavior policy, is widely used in offline reinforcement learning (RL) to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of unseen actions. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in HRL is that the low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[GenPO: Generative Diffusion Models Meet On-Policy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18763v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2025.

Recent works show their promise for sequential decision-making and dexterous manipulation, leveraging their ability to model complex action distributions. However, challenges persist due to the data limitations and scenario-specific adaptation needs. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing an optimized approach to training diffusion policies using large, pre-built datasets that are enhanced using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our end-to-end pipeline leverages RL-based enhancement of the DexGraspNet dataset, lightweight diffusion policy training on a dexterous manipulation task for a five-fingered robotic hand, and a pose sampling algorithm for validation. The pipeline achieved a high success rate of 80% for three DexGraspNet objects. By eliminating manual data collection, our approach lowers barriers to adopting diffusion models in robotics, enhancing generalization and robustness for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects in 3D: Simulation, Benchmark and Learning Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17434v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation is inherently challenging due to complex system dynamics and stringent task constraints, particularly in deformable object scenarios characterized by high degrees of freedom and underactuation. Prior methods often simplify the problem to low-speed or 2D settings, limiting their applicability to real-world 3D tasks. In this work, we explore 3D goal-conditioned rope manipulation as a representative challenge. To mitigate data scarcity, we introduce a novel simulation framework and benchmark grounded in reduced-order dynamics, which enables compact state representation and facilitates efficient policy learning. Building on this, we propose Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP), a framework that integrates imitation pretraining with physics-informed test-time adaptation. First, we design a diffusion policy that learns inverse dynamics within the reduced-order space, enabling imitation learning to move beyond na\"ive data fitting and capture the underlying physical structure. Second, we propose a physics-informed test-time adaptation scheme that imposes kinematic boundary conditions and structured dynamics priors on the diffusion process, ensuring consistency and reliability in manipulation execution. Extensive experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating strong performance in terms of accuracy and robustness in the learned policy.</p></details> | 11 pages, |
| **[Safe Uncertainty-Aware Learning of Robotic Suturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16596v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario. Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera, and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations, showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety set in the case of unsafe predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Diffusion Models for Neural Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15157v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.</p></details> | ICRA'25 |
| **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Group and Grasp Multiple Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08452v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously grasping and delivering multiple objects can significantly enhance robotic work efficiency and has been a key research focus for decades. The primary challenge lies in determining how to push objects, group them, and execute simultaneous grasping for respective groups while considering object distribution and the hardware constraints of the robot. Traditional rule-based methods struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an imitation learning-based approach. We collect a series of expert demonstrations through teleoperation and train a diffusion policy network, enabling the robot to dynamically generate action sequences for pushing, grouping, and grasping, thereby facilitating efficient multi-object grasping and delivery. We conducted experiments to evaluate the method under different training dataset sizes, varying object quantities, and real-world object scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively and adaptively generate multi-object grouping and grasping strategies. With the support of more training data, imitation learning is expected to be an effective approach for solving the multi-object grasping problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Diffusion Policy Training: Decoupling and Recombining Guidance and Diffusion for Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03154v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations, actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior, suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model, based on three key findings: Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity for optimization. Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and enhances both sample efficiency and final performance. Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability. We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular, reusable, and composable training pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Long-Context Diffusion Policies via Past-Token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09561v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos are available at https://long-context-dp.github.io</p></details> |
| **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, limiting their applicability to tasks where historical context is crucial for disambiguating current observations. This limitation hinders performance in long-horizon sequential manipulation tasks where the correct action depends on past events not fully captured by the current state. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL), a novel approach that leverages the recurrent state dynamics inherent in State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the Mamba architecture. MTIL encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed hidden state, conditioning action predictions on this comprehensive temporal context alongside current multi-modal observations. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT dataset tasks, Robomimic, LIBERO) and real-world sequential manipulation tasks specifically designed to probe temporal dependencies, MTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy. Our findings affirm the necessity of full temporal context for robust sequential decision-making and validate MTIL as a powerful approach that transcends the inherent limitations of Markovian imitation learning</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures,Submitted to IEEE RAL</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11719v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

| **[Fast and Robust Visuomotor Riemannian Flow Matching Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10855v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at learning complex robotic tasks by effectively combining visual data with high-dimensional, multi-modal action distributions. However, diffusion models often suffer from slow inference due to costly denoising processes or require complex sequential training arising from recent distilling approaches. This paper introduces Riemannian Flow Matching Policy (RFMP), a model that inherits the easy training and fast inference capabilities of flow matching (FM). Moreover, RFMP inherently incorporates geometric constraints commonly found in realistic robotic applications, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold. To enhance the robustness of RFMP, we propose Stable RFMP (SRFMP), which leverages LaSalle's invariance principle to equip the dynamics of FM with stability to the support of a target Riemannian distribution. Rigorous evaluation on eight simulated and real-world tasks show that RFMP successfully learns and synthesizes complex sensorimotor policies on Euclidean and Riemannian spaces with efficient training and inference phases, outperforming Diffusion Policies and Consistency Policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, 12 tables, project website: https://sites.google.com/view/rfmp</p></details> |
| **[Exploratory Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07279v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to pre-train agents by exploring diverse states or skills in reward-free environments, facilitating efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. As the agent cannot access extrinsic rewards during unsupervised exploration, existing methods design intrinsic rewards to model the explored data and encourage further exploration. However, the explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful representation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained policies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM), which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the explored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion model and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM enables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical analyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies, addressing key challenges such as training instability and computational complexity caused by multi-step sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExDM outperforms existing SOTA baselines in efficient unsupervised exploration and fast fine-tuning downstream tasks, especially in structurally complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning Matters: Training Diffusion Policies is Faster Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11123v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have emerged as a mainstream paradigm for building vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although they demonstrate strong robot control capabilities, their training efficiency remains suboptimal. In this work, we identify a fundamental challenge in conditional diffusion policy training: when generative conditions are hard to distinguish, the training objective degenerates into modeling the marginal action distribution, a phenomenon we term loss collapse. To overcome this, we propose Cocos, a simple yet general solution that modifies the source distribution in the conditional flow matching to be condition-dependent. By anchoring the source distribution around semantics extracted from condition inputs, Cocos encourages stronger condition integration and prevents the loss collapse. We provide theoretical justification and extensive empirical results across simulation and real-world benchmarks. Our method achieves faster convergence and higher success rates than existing approaches, matching the performance of large-scale pre-trained VLAs using significantly fewer gradient steps and parameters. Cocos is lightweight, easy to implement, and compatible with diverse policy architectures, offering a general-purpose improvement to diffusion policy training.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.10105</p></details> |
| **[Prior-Guided Diffusion Planning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10881v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing, generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However, existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance, Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[NavDP: Learning Sim-to-Real Navigation Diffusion Policy with Privileged Information Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08712v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots. Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wzcai99.github.io/navigation-diffusion-policy.github.io/</p></details> |
