| **[When Vision Overrides Language: Evaluating and Mitigating Counterfactual Failures in VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-va.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EgoScale: Scaling Dexterous Manipulation with Diverse Egocentric Human Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16710v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation, attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits its applicability in real-time robotic systems. Existing approaches accelerate sampling in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting techniques originally developed to speed up image generation. However, a major distinction exists: image generation typically produces independent samples without temporal dependencies, while robotic manipulation requires generating action trajectories with continuity and temporal coherence. To this end, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. Concretely, we introduce a frequency consistency constraint objective that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on 40 tasks of LIBERO. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency of 93.5 Hz.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap." We first characterize the test-time scaling laws for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce CoVer-VLA, a hierarchical test-time verification pipeline using the trained verifier. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses the verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer-VLA achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Action Models are Zero-shot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15922v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dreamzero0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Selective Perception for Robot: Task-Aware Attention in Multimodal VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15543v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoIRA: Modular Instruction Routing Architecture for Multi-Task Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01843v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $π_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to reflect the final accepted version published in Neurocomputing</p></details> |
| **[ActionCodec: What Makes for Good Action Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15397v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DM0: An Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action Model towards Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14974v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

| **[DriveFine: Refining-Augmented Masked Diffusion VLA for Precise and Robust Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14577v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $π_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $π_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAP: Language-Action Pre-Training Enables Zero-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10556v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://lap-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Semantic-Contact Fields for Category-Level Generalizable Tactile Tool Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13833v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors. To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Learning Action Motifs for Few-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13764v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings. Code is available at https://github.com/buduz/MOTIF.</p></details> |  |
| **[HBVLA: Pushing 1-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13710v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowHOI: Flow-based Semantics-Grounded Generation of Hand-Object Interactions for Dexterous Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13444v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://huajian-zeng.github.io/projects/flowhoi/</p></details> |
| **[InternVLA-A1: Unifying Understanding, Generation and Action for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02456v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and demonstrate exceptional proficiency in semantic understanding, but they inherently lack the capability to deduce physical world dynamics. Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap.

The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Steerable Vision-Language-Action Policies for Embodied Reasoning and Hierarchical Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13193v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

| **[Learning Native Continuation for Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12978v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lyfeng001.github.io/Legato/</p></details> |
| **[SteerVLA: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models in Long-Tail Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08440v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

| **[ALOE: Action-Level Off-Policy Evaluation for Vision-Language-Action Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12691v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA on robot manipulation problems and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we prefer VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs.

Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark that consists of 11 diverse, multi-step real-world tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 87.4%, demonstrating a +40.9% absolute improvement over the $π_0$ baseline (46.5%) and a +30.3% absolute improvement over $π_0$ augmented with textual subtask guidance (57.1%).</p></details> |  |

In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain05m.github.io/</p></details> |

The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment.

| **[When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.</p></details> |  |

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/kai0-rl/</p></details> |

This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (10 pages main text + 12 pages appendix), 18 figures</p></details> |
| **[AugVLA-3D: Depth-Driven Feature Augmentation for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10698v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation. Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[BagelVLA: Enhancing Long-Horizon Manipulation via Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09849v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardware Co-Design Scaling Laws via Roofline Modelling for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10377v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/EgoHumanoid</p></details> |

However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

Artificial intelligence and robotics solutions could facilitate their operations, compensating these difficulties. To this end, we propose a dataset for gesture-based UGV control by FRs, introducing a set of 12 commands, drawing inspiration from existing gestures used by FRs and tactical hand signals and refined after incorporating feedback from experienced FRs. Then we proceed with the data collection itself, resulting in 3312 RGBD pairs captured from 2 viewpoints and 7 distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset especially intended for gesture-based UGV guidance by FRs. Finally we define evaluation protocols for our RGBD dataset, termed FR-GESTURE, and we perform baseline experiments, which are put forward for improvement. We have made data publicly available to promote future research on the domain: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18131333.</p></details> |  |

We present the Intelligent Robotic Imaging System (IRIS), a task-specific 6-DOF manipulator designed for autonomous, learning-driven cinematic motion control. IRIS integrates a lightweight, fully 3D-printed hardware design with a goal-conditioned visuomotor imitation learning framework based on Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). The system learns object-aware and perceptually smooth camera trajectories directly from human demonstrations, eliminating the need for explicit geometric programming. The complete platform costs under $1,000 USD, supports a 1.5 kg payload, and achieves approximately 1 mm repeatability. Real-world experiments demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, reliable autonomous execution, and generalization across diverse cinematic motions.</p></details> |  |

Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[I-FailSense: Towards General Robotic Failure Detection with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16072v3)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage: https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Virtual Model Control for Scalable Human-Robot Collaboration in Shared Workspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17415v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git</p></details> | 28 pages, 30 figures |

When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Theory of Mind for Artificial Intelligence (ToM4AI) at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used, focusing on the software and hardware employed and the application contexts in which they are deployed, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the challenges and future directions. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still driven by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications - such as the hardware, software, and robots used - are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and hardly interactive visual stimulus, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging (e.g. motion capturing) functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. While there are gaps in demographic reporting, the research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short study cycles. We propose a four-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes (1) strengthen application contexts, (2) more robust and testable technological iterations, (3) embedding diversity in samples and research teams, and (4) the need for reporting standards, e.g., in form of a suitable taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.</p></details> | This is a pre-print |

We conducted a field study in a science museum where each blind participant (n=8) joined a group tour with one guide and two sighted participants (n=8). Findings indicated users' sense of safety from the robot's navigational support, concerns in the group participation, and preferences for obtaining environmental information.

However, coordinating hybrid robots remains challenging, due to difficulties in modeling, perception, and cross-domain kinematics.

Using an AR headset, users can interact with a simulated model of the robotic system integrated into a general-purpose physics engine, which is superimposed on the real system, allowing simulated execution prior to real-world deployment.

| **[Grasp Synthesis Matching From Rigid To Soft Robot Grippers Using Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17110v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A representation gap exists between grasp synthesis for rigid and soft grippers. Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking the Effects of Object Pose Estimation and Reconstruction on Robotic Grasping Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17101v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots.</p></details> |  |

We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting.</p></details> |  |

The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.</p></details> |  |

However, these features may expose users to unwanted privacy risks, including unsolicited data collection and unauthorized data sharing. While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time. We synthesize our findings into actionable design recommendations for robot manufacturers and developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (main body), 2 figures</p></details> |

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</p></details> |  |

Let Me Pass By": Navigating Public Pathways with Walk-along with Robots in Crowded City Streets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16861v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the presence of autonomous robots in public spaces increases-whether navigating campus walkways or neighborhood sidewalks-understanding how to carefully study these robots becomes critical. While HRI research has conducted field studies in public spaces, these are often limited to controlled experiments with prototype robots or structured observational methods, such as the Wizard of Oz technique. However, the autonomous mobile robots we encounter today, particularly delivery robots, operate beyond the control of researchers, navigating dynamic routes and unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a more deliberate approach is required. Drawing inspiration from public realm ethnography in urban studies, geography, and sociology, this paper proposes the Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology. We outline the key features of this method, the steps we applied in our study, the unique insights it offers, and the ways it can be evaluated. We hope this paper stimulates further discussion on research methodologies for studying autonomous robots in public spaces.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI '26)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Autonomous Robotic Kidney Ultrasound: Spatial-Efficient Volumetric Imaging via Template Guided Optimal Pivoting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16641v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep.</p></details> |  |

Existing frameworks for educational technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutoring-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university students and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly personality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educational strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expectations.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments still presents open challenges, mainly due to computational requirements. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything combines pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding. It proposes an efficient storage of open-vocabulary information through the aggregation of features at the object level. Pixelwise vision-language features are aggregated based on eSAM segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. We demonstrate that FindAnything performs on par with the state-of-the-art in terms of semantic accuracy while being substantially faster and more memory-efficient, allowing its deployment in large-scale environments and on resourceconstrained devices, such as MAVs. We show that the real-time capabilities of FindAnything make it useful for downstream tasks, such as autonomous MAV exploration in a simulated Search and Rescue scenario.

Most existing surgical AI methods rely on isolated, task-specific models, leading to fragmented pipelines with limited interpretability and no unified understanding of RAS scene. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer strong zero-shot reasoning, but struggle with hallucinations, domain gaps and weak task-interdependency modeling. To address the lack of unified data for RAS scene understanding, we introduce SurgCoTBench, the first reasoning-focused benchmark in RAS, covering 14256 QA pairs with frame-level annotations across five major surgical tasks. Building on SurgCoTBench, we propose SurgRAW, a clinically aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) driven agentic workflow for zero-shot multi-task reasoning in surgery. SurgRAW employs a hierarchical reasoning workflow where an orchestrator divides surgical scene understanding into two reasoning streams and directs specialized agents to generate task-level reasoning, while higher-level agents capture workflow interdependencies or ground output clinically. Specifically, we propose a panel discussion mechanism to ensure task-specific agents collaborate synergistically and leverage on task interdependencies. Similarly, we incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation module to enrich agents with surgical knowledge and alleviate domain gaps in general VLMs. We design task-specific CoT prompts grounded in surgical domain to ensure clinically aligned reasoning, reduce hallucinations and enhance interpretability. Extensive experiments show that SurgRAW surpasses mainstream VLMs and agentic systems and outperforms a supervised model by 14.61% accuracy.

The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 17 figures, published in Elsevier Precision Engineering (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141635925001266)</p></details> |

These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Access, website: https://haraduka.github.io/urdf-llm-opt/ , video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9iMjx7of1w</p></details> |

Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted contribution to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations. Videos are available at https://bigpicturepolicies.github.io/</p></details> |  |

In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the performance and robustness of diffusion policy learning for contact-rich assembly at the construction scale, using a tight-fitting timber mortise and tenon joint as a case study. A two-phase experimental study is conducted: first, to evaluate baseline policy performance and applicability; second, to assess policy robustness under fabrication-induced uncertainties modeled as randomized perturbations to the mortise position. The diffusion policy is trained on teleoperated demonstrations using an industrial robotic arm conditioned on end-effector pose and force/torque feedback. The best-performing policy achieved a total average success rate of 75% under perturbations up to 10 mm, including 100% success in unperturbed cases. The results demonstrate the potential of sensory-motor diffusion policies to enable high-precision contact-rich manipulation on large-scale industrial robotic arms, reducing reliance on skilled manual intervention. This work advances robotic construction under uncertainty and provides practical insights for deploying learning-based control in real-world Architectural, Engineering, and Construction applications.</p></details> |  |

ODYN combines all-shifted nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) functions with proximal method of multipliers to robustly address ill-conditioned and degenerate problems, without requiring linear independence of the constraints. It exhibits strong warm-start performance and is well suited to both general-purpose optimization, and robotics and AI applications, including model-based control, estimation, and kernel-based learning methods. We provide an open-source implementation and benchmark ODYN on the Maros-Mészáros test set, demonstrating state-of-the-art convergence performance in small-to-high-scale problems. The results highlight ODYN's superior warm-starting capabilities, which are critical in sequential and real-time settings common in robotics and AI. These advantages are further demonstrated by deploying ODYN as the backend of an SQP-based predictive control framework (OdynSQP), as the implicitly differentiable optimization layer for deep learning (ODYNLayer), and the optimizer of a contact-dynamics simulation (ODYNSim).</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table. Our work has implications for in-the-wild and group contexts of robot-assisted feeding.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures.

This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2026 Original Contribution, Vienne, Austria</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Multi-Robot Non-Prehensile Manipulation via Flow-Matching Co-Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10874v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between "grip" and "slip" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Vienna</p></details> |
| **[Constraining Streaming Flow Models for Adapting Learned Robot Trajectory Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15567v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figure |
| **[Selective Perception for Robot: Task-Aware Attention in Multimodal VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15543v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dynamic programming algorithm (PA) introduced in arXiv:2402.12019 and present three baselines for comparison: an integer programming approach (IP) that always yields an optimal solution, a greedy algorithm (GA), and a simple randomized algorithm (RA). We show that for a path graph, PA, GA, and RA find solutions several orders of magnitude faster than IP (the optimal baseline), with PA returning optimal results in the vast majority of cases. Our scaled experiments comparing non-optimal algorithms show that the average schedule timespan produced by PA is less than half that of RA and GA. This outperformance is consistent across varying path lengths, task durations and distributions, number and allocations of tasks and robots, and task-to-robot ratios. This work serves two purposes. First, we present three algorithms for scheduling on line graphs, including a novel integer programming formulation for finding optimal solutions.

| **[MoIRA: Modular Instruction Routing Architecture for Multi-Task Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01843v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $π_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to reflect the final accepted version published in Neurocomputing</p></details> |

Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment. A video of the experiments is available at http://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d6.

A Lyapunov function is constructed to yield explicit bounds and $\mathcal{L}_2$ stability results, supporting feedback synthesis that reduces configuration dependent effects. The resulting control law maintains a PI-like form suitable for standard embedded implementation while preserving rigorous stability properties.

However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries.</p></details> |  |

This problem arises under obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a third robot on the straight line segment between them. This problem was solved by Sharma et al. [ICDCN, 2018] in the luminous robots model, where each robot is equipped with an externally visible light that can assume colors from a fixed set of colors, using 9 colors and $O(n)$ rounds. In this work, we present an algorithm that requires only 2 colors and $O(n)$ rounds. The number of colors is optimal since at least two colors are required even for point robots [Di Luna et al., Information and Computation, 2017].</p></details> |  |
| **[OSCAR: An Ovipositor-Inspired Self-Propelling Capsule Robot for Colonoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15309v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-propelling robotic capsules eliminate shaft looping of conventional colonoscopy, reducing patient discomfort. However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LapSurgie: Humanoid Robots Performing Surgery via Teleoperated Handheld Laparoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03529v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback. Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.</p></details> |  |

We address this gap by evaluating a prototype that fuses robot-mounted depth sensing and YOLO detection with a vision language model (VLM) capable of verbalizing metrically-grounded distances of detected objects (e.g., the chair is 3.02 meters away). In a mixed-reality toxic-smoke scenario, participants estimated distances to a victim and an exit window under three conditions: video-only, depth-agnostic VLM, and depth-augmented VLM. Depth-augmentation improved objective accuracy and stability, e.g., the victim and window distance estimation error dropped, while raising situational awareness without increasing workload. Conversely, depth- agnostic assistance increased workload and slightly worsened accuracy. We contribute to human SA augmentation by demonstrating that metrically grounded, object-centric verbal information supports spatial reasoning in EFR and improves decision-relevant judgments under time pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A ROS2 Benchmarking Framework for Hierarchical Control Strategies in Mobile Robots for Mediterranean Greenhouses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15162v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots operating in agroindustrial environments, such as Mediterranean greenhouses, are subject to challenging conditions, including uneven terrain, variable friction, payload changes, and terrain slopes, all of which significantly affect control performance and stability. Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.</p></details> | 53 pages |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Accepted to RA-L |

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData) 2025</p></details> |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

| **[AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[LATA: Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation for Conformal Uncertainty in Medical VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17535v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[I-FailSense: Towards General Robotic Failure Detection with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16072v3)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage: https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Training for Large Vision Language Models via Visual Information Gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17186v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Anti-forensics Attack against Image Forgery Detection via Multi-modal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06530v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Narrow fine-tuning erodes safety alignment in vision-language agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16931v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</p></details> |  |
| **[DODO: Discrete OCR Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16872v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR.

Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bongard-RWR+: Real-World Representations of Fine-Grained Concepts in Bongard Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12026v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 paper |
| **[Saliency-Aware Multi-Route Thinking: Revisiting Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16702v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint 10 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

To enhance user experience, recent studies have investigated VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single concepts, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes MC-LLaVA, a multi-concept personalization paradigm. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the training costs, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To further push the performance upper bound, we incorporate an optional auxiliary loss, better enhancing the proposed personalized prompts. To decorate the VLM personalization research, we contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually create question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA achieves impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user assistants. The code and dataset will be released at \href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Contrastive Learning Framework Empowered by Attention-based Feature Adaptation for Street-View Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16590v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter.</p></details> |  |

However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurgRAW: Multi-Agent Workflow with Chain of Thought Reasoning for Robotic Surgical Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10265v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is central to modern surgery, driving the need for intelligent systems with accurate scene understanding. Most existing surgical AI methods rely on isolated, task-specific models, leading to fragmented pipelines with limited interpretability and no unified understanding of RAS scene. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer strong zero-shot reasoning, but struggle with hallucinations, domain gaps and weak task-interdependency modeling. To address the lack of unified data for RAS scene understanding, we introduce SurgCoTBench, the first reasoning-focused benchmark in RAS, covering 14256 QA pairs with frame-level annotations across five major surgical tasks. Building on SurgCoTBench, we propose SurgRAW, a clinically aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) driven agentic workflow for zero-shot multi-task reasoning in surgery. SurgRAW employs a hierarchical reasoning workflow where an orchestrator divides surgical scene understanding into two reasoning streams and directs specialized agents to generate task-level reasoning, while higher-level agents capture workflow interdependencies or ground output clinically. Specifically, we propose a panel discussion mechanism to ensure task-specific agents collaborate synergistically and leverage on task interdependencies. Similarly, we incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation module to enrich agents with surgical knowledge and alleviate domain gaps in general VLMs. We design task-specific CoT prompts grounded in surgical domain to ensure clinically aligned reasoning, reduce hallucinations and enhance interpretability. Extensive experiments show that SurgRAW surpasses mainstream VLMs and agentic systems and outperforms a supervised model by 14.61% accuracy. Dataset and code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurgRAW.git .</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Self-Refine: A Pixel-Guided Paradigm for Accurate Chart Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16455v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision and Language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  |
| **[BPP: Long-Context Robot Imitation Learning by Focusing on Key History Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15010v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations. Videos are available at https://bigpicturepolicies.github.io/</p></details> |  |

In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |
| **[LMSeg: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00364v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap." We first characterize the test-time scaling laws for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce CoVer-VLA, a hierarchical test-time verification pipeline using the trained verifier. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses the verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer-VLA achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by rapid-prototyping in manufacturing, we propose a fast, low-cost evaluation method using Vision-Language Model (VLM) personas to simulate outcomes comparable to field results. While LLMs show human-like reasoning and language capabilities, autonomous vehicle (AV)-pedestrian interaction requires spatial awareness, emotional empathy, and behavioral generation. This raises our research question: To what extent can VLM personas mimic human responses in field studies? We conducted parallel studies: 1) one real-world study with 20 participants, and 2) one video-study using 20 VLM personas, both on a street-crossing task. We compared their responses and interviewed five HCI researchers on potential applications. Results show that VLM personas mimic human response patterns (e.g., average crossing times of 5.25 s vs. 5.07 s) lack the behavioral variability and depth. They show promise for formative studies, field study preparation, and human data augmentation.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2026 |

We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic. Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Patte...</summary><p>Pattern Recognition Letters 2026</p></details> |

Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.</p></details> |  |

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.</p></details> |  |

This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026.

This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) Workshops</p></details> |

Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport.

Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15950v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15927v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks. We release the source code at https://github.com/chs20/visual-memory-injection</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |
| **[LeafNet: A Large-Scale Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark for Foundational Vision-Language Understanding of Plant Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13662v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

| **[cadrille: Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22914v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/col14m/cadrille .</p></details> | ICLR 2026 (Oral) |
| **[Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG: Towards Interpretable and Accurate Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15650v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARE Drive A Framework for Evaluating Reason-Responsiveness of Vision Language Models in Automated Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15645v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, on submission to Transportation Research Part C</p></details> |
| **[Req2Road: A GenAI Pipeline for SDV Test Artifact Generation and On-Vehicle Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15591v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing functionality in Software-Defined Vehicles is challenging because requirements are written in natural language, specifications combine text, tables, and diagrams, while test assets are scattered across heterogeneous toolchains. Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models are used to extract signals and behavioral logic to automatically generate Gherkin scenarios, which are then converted into runnable test scripts. The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration standardizes signal references, supporting portability across subsystems and test benches. The pipeline uses retrieval-augmented generation to preselect candidate VSS signals before mapping. We evaluate the approach on the safety-relevant Child Presence Detection System, executing the generated tests in a virtual environment and on an actual vehicle. Our evaluation covers Gherkin validity, VSS mapping quality, and end-to-end executability. Results show that 32 of 36 requirements (89\%) can be transformed into executable scenarios in our setting, while human review and targeted substitutions remain necessary. This paper is a feasibility and architectural demonstration of an end-to-end requirements-to-test pipeline for SDV subsystems, evaluated on a CPDS case in simulation and Vehicle-in-the-Loop settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CAiSE 2026 main</p></details> |
| **[VLM-DEWM: Dynamic External World Model for Verifiable and Resilient Vision-Language Planning in Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15549v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language model (VLM) shows promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing, yet their deployment in dynamic workcells faces two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation, they cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift; and (2) opaque reasoning, failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries. This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Perception for Robot: Task-Aware Attention in Multimodal VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15543v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transient Object Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15516v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[LQA: A Lightweight Quantized-Adaptive Framework for Vision-Language Models on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07849v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices is challenged by resource constraints and performance degradation under distribution shifts. While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets. These results demonstrate that LQA offers a practical pathway for robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient VLM deployment on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures ,9 tables, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Annotation-Efficient Vision-Language Model Adaptation to the Polish Language Using the LLaVA Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14073v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on English-centric data, limiting their performance in other languages and cultural contexts. This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs for Simple Visual Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15460v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActionCodec: What Makes for Good Action Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15397v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Vision Wormhole: Latent-Space Communication in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15382v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

| **[AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Computer-Using World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17365v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents operating in complex software environments benefit from reasoning about the consequences of their actions, as even a single incorrect user interface (UI) operation can derail long, artifact-preserving workflows. This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://h-zhao1997.github.io/frappe</p></details> |

We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07463v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</p></details> |  |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/ccolas/language_and_experience Demo: cedriccolas.com/demos/language_and_experience</p></details> |
| **[Factored Latent Action World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16229v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Failure Classification and Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16182v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07854v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Model-Augmented Web Agents with Action Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |
| **[Cold-Start Personalization via Training-Free Priors from Structured World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15012v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey on Scenario Generation and Scenario Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11526v4)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

| **[World Models for Policy Refinement in StarCraft II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14857v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06130v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Compact LLM Deployment and World Model Assisted Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13628v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Snapshot Sensing to Persistent EM World Modeling: A Generative-Space Perspective for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13554v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic (EM) world modeling is emerging as a foundational capability for environment-aware and embodiment-enabled wireless systems. However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures/tables</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 0 figures.

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised JEPA-based World Models for LiDAR Occupancy Completion and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12540v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving, as an agent operating in the physical world, requires the fundamental capability to build \textit{world models} that capture how the environment evolves spatiotemporally in order to support long-term planning. At the same time, scalability demands learning such models in a self-supervised manner; \textit{joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA)} enables learning world models via leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data without relying on expensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AD-LiST-JEPA}, a self-supervised world model for autonomous driving that predicts future spatiotemporal evolution from LiDAR data using a JEPA framework. We evaluate the quality of the learned representations through a downstream LiDAR-based occupancy completion and forecasting (OCF) task, which jointly assesses perception and prediction. Proof of concept experiments show better OCF performance with pretrained encoder after JEPA-based world model learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.Code and videos: https://lift-humanoid.github.io</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23864v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

For these systems it is valuable to anticipate how a bin will look from the current observations and the planned stow behavior before real execution. We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Policy4OOD: A Knowledge-Guided World Model for Policy Intervention Simulation against the Opioid Overdose Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12373v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Observer Effect in World Models: Invasive Adaptation Corrupts Latent Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12218v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LDA-1B: Scaling Latent Dynamics Action Model via Universal Embodied Data Ingestion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12215v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page:https://pku-epic.github.io/LDA</p></details> |

In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain05m.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Synergy for Interactive World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10480v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Robotic Reinforcement Learning with Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11978v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

| **[Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10983v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://haic-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> |

While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.</p></details> | 43 pages, ICLR 2026 |

We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for training in operational systems or computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators, e.g., reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or learned world models, can cheaply provide useful data, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), a sample-efficient RL framework that mixes scarce target-environment data with a control variate formed from abundant low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a practical, multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. Under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence to locally optimal policies in the target environment and achieves faster finite-sample convergence than standard REINFORCE. We evaluate MFPG on robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. When low-fidelity data are neutral or beneficial and dynamics gaps are mild-moderate, MFPG is, among the evaluated off-dynamics RL and low-fidelity-only approaches, the only method that consistently achieves statistically significant improvements over a high-fidelity-only baseline. When low-fidelity data become harmful, MFPG exhibits the strongest robustness, whereas strong off-dynamics RL methods exploit low-fidelity data aggressively and fail much more severely. An additional experiment with anti-correlated high- and low-fidelity rewards shows MFPG can remain effective even under reward misspecification. MFPG thus offers a reliable paradigm for exploiting cheap low-fidelity data (e.g., for efficient sim-to-real transfer) while managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11389v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
