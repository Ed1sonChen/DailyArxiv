| **[DM0: An Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action Model towards Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14974v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

| **[DriveFine: Refining-Augmented Masked Diffusion VLA for Precise and Robust Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14577v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $π_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $π_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAP: Language-Action Pre-Training Enables Zero-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10556v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://lap-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Semantic-Contact Fields for Category-Level Generalizable Tactile Tool Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13833v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors. To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Learning Action Motifs for Few-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13764v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings. Code is available at https://github.com/buduz/MOTIF.</p></details> |  |
| **[HBVLA: Pushing 1-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13710v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowHOI: Flow-based Semantics-Grounded Generation of Hand-Object Interactions for Dexterous Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13444v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://huajian-zeng.github.io/projects/flowhoi/</p></details> |
| **[InternVLA-A1: Unifying Understanding, Generation and Action for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02456v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and demonstrate exceptional proficiency in semantic understanding, but they inherently lack the capability to deduce physical world dynamics. Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Steerable Vision-Language-Action Policies for Embodied Reasoning and Hierarchical Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13193v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

| **[UniManip: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation with Agentic Operational Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13086v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation requires robots to seamlessly bridge high-level semantic intent with low-level physical interaction in unstructured environments. However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

| **[Learning Native Continuation for Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12978v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lyfeng001.github.io/Legato/</p></details> |
| **[SteerVLA: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models in Long-Tail Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08440v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

| **[ALOE: Action-Level Off-Policy Evaluation for Vision-Language-Action Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12691v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training. Videos and additional materials are available at our project website.</p></details> |  |

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

| **[CRAFT: Adapting VLA Models to Contact-rich Manipulation via Force-aware Curriculum Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12532v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown a strong capability in enabling robots to execute general instructions, yet they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks, where success requires precise alignment, stable contact maintenance, and effective handling of deformable objects. A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA on robot manipulation problems and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we prefer VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research.

| **[Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23864v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</p></details> |  |

We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark that consists of 11 diverse, multi-step real-world tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 87.4%, demonstrating a +40.9% absolute improvement over the $π_0$ baseline (46.5%) and a +30.3% absolute improvement over $π_0$ augmented with textual subtask guidance (57.1%).</p></details> |  |

In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain05m.github.io/</p></details> |

The core of our system is a novel VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates robot embodiment priors, including multi-view camera parameters and kinematic descriptions (URDF), to enhance 3D spatial reasoning and support diverse embodiments. We validate this design through a scalable ``pre-train then post-train" paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results on simulation benchmarks such as RoboTwin 2.0, LIBERO, and GenieSim, as well as strong results on challenging long-horizon real-world manipulation tasks. Notably, our efficient 0.2B-parameter variant rivals significantly larger baselines, enabling low-latency on-device deployment. To further accelerate research and practical adoption, we fully open-source the entire HoloBrain ecosystem, which includes: (1) powerful pre-trained VLA foundations; (2) post-trained checkpoints for multiple simulation suites and real-world tasks; and (3) RoboOrchard, a full-stack VLA infrastructure for data curation, model training and deployment. Together with standardized data collection protocols, this release provides the community with a complete, reproducible path toward high-performance robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[JEPA-VLA: Video Predictive Embedding is Needed for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11832v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10983v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/kai0-rl/</p></details> |

This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation. Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments.

However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

| **[From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[RoboInter: A Holistic Intermediate Representation Suite Towards Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09973v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have stimulated growing interest in vision-language-action (VLA) systems for robot manipulation. However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision. In total, RoboInter establishes a practical foundation for advancing robust and generalizable robotic learning via fine-grained and diverse intermediate representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to ICLR 2026, 69 pages, 40 figures</p></details> |
| **[NavDreamer: Video Models as Zero-Shot 3D Navigators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09765v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous Vision-Language-Action models face critical limitations in navigation: scarce, diverse data from labor-intensive collection and static representations that fail to capture temporal dynamics and physical laws. We propose NavDreamer, a video-based framework for 3D navigation that leverages generative video models as a universal interface between language instructions and navigation trajectories. Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust generalization across novel objects and unseen environments, with ablation studies revealing that navigation's high-level decision-making nature makes it particularly suited for video-based planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in the progress. 22 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | WIP |
| **[Rethinking Visual-Language-Action Model Scaling: Alignment, Mixture, and Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09722v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong promise for generalist robot control, it remains unclear whether -- and under what conditions -- the standard "scale data" recipe translates to robotics, where training data is inherently heterogeneous across embodiments, sensors, and action spaces. We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

| **[AutoFly: Vision-Language-Action Model for UAV Autonomous Navigation in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09657v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires intelligent agents to navigate environments by interpreting linguistic instructions alongside visual observations, serving as a cornerstone task in Embodied AI. Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments.</p></details> | Acceped by ICLR 2026 |

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop. Neurosim and Cortex are available at https://github.com/grasp-lyrl/neurosim .</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-Grounding Graph: Unified Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph from Robotic Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18697v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Accepted to RA-L |
| **[Language Movement Primitives: Grounding Language Models in Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02839v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline.

While mobile applications provide convenient navigation support, they occupy the user's hands and visual attention, limiting natural interaction. In this paper, we explore conversation hand-off as a method for multi-device indoor navigation, where a Conversational Agent (CA) transitions seamlessly from a stationary social robot to a wearable device. We evaluated robot-only, wearable-only, and robot-to-wearable hand-off in a university campus setting using a within-subjects design with N=24 participants. We find that conversation hand-off is experienced as engaging, even though no performance benefits were observed, and most preferred using the wearable-only system. Our findings suggest that the design of such re-embodied assistants should maintain a shared voice and state across embodiments. We demonstrate how conversational hand-offs can bridge cognitive and physical transitions, enriching human interaction with embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of Augmented Humans International Conference (AHs 2026)</p></details> |

Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5, figures, Accepted for 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

Robotic systems, particularly continuum robots, provide flexible instruments that enable precise tissue resection, potentially improving outcomes. This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries.</p></details> |  |

Employing causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships facilitates the prediction of human behaviours and enables the anticipation of robot interventions. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of implementation of existing causal discovery methods within the ROS ecosystem, the standard de-facto framework in robotics, hindering effective utilisation on real robots. To bridge this gap, in our previous work we proposed ROS-Causal, a ROS-based framework designed for onboard data collection and causal discovery in human-robot spatial interactions. In this work, we present an experimental evaluation of ROS-Causal both in simulation and on a new dataset of human-robot spatial interactions in a lab scenario, to assess its performance and effectiveness. Our analysis demonstrates the efficacy of this approach, showcasing how causal models can be extracted directly onboard by robots during data collection. The online causal models generated from the simulation are consistent with those from lab experiments. These findings can help researchers to enhance the performance of robotic systems in shared environments, firstly by studying the causal relations between variables in simulation without real people, and then facilitating the actual robot deployment in real human environments.

The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 Figures |
| **[Replanning Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks with Vision-Language Models via Semantic and Physical Dual-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14551v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2026)</p></details> |

The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Soft Wrist with Anisotropic and Selectable Stiffness for Robust Robot Learning in Contact-rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14434v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

| **[ORACLE-Grasp: Zero-Shot Affordance-Aligned Robotic Grasping using Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08417v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping unknown objects in unstructured environments is a critical challenge for service robots, which must operate in dynamic, real-world settings such as homes, hospitals, and warehouses. Success in these environments requires both semantic understanding and spatial reasoning. Traditional methods often rely on dense training datasets or detailed geometric modeling, which demand extensive data collection and do not generalize well to novel objects or affordances. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) as semantic oracles to guide affordance-aligned grasp selection, without requiring task-specific training or manual input. The system reformulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using a dual-prompt tool-calling strategy: the first prompt extracts high-level object semantics, while the second identifies graspable regions aligned with the object's function. To address the spatial limitations of LMMs, ORACLE-Grasp discretizes the image into candidate regions and reasons over them to produce human-like and context-sensitive grasp suggestions. A depth-based refinement step improves grasp reliability when available, and an early stopping mechanism enhances computational efficiency. We evaluate ORACLE-Grasp on a diverse set of RGB and RGB-D images featuring both everyday and AI-generated objects. The results show that our method produces physically feasible and semantically appropriate grasps that align closely with human annotations, achieving high success rates in real-world pick-up tasks. Our findings highlight the potential of LMMs for enabling flexible and generalizable grasping strategies in autonomous service robots, eliminating the need for object-specific models or extensive training.</p></details> |  |

The method combines force-based parameter estimation using a commercial force/torque sensor with an ergodic control strategy driven by a tailored Expected Information Density, which explicitly biases exploration toward diagnostically relevant regions by jointly considering model uncertainty, stiffness magnitude, and spatial gradients. An Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate viscoelastic model parameters online, while Gaussian Process Regression provides spatial modelling of the estimated elasticity, and a Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage controller enables adaptive, continuous trajectory planning. Simulations on synthetic stiffness maps demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better reconstruction accuracy, enhanced segmentation capability, and improved robustness in detecting stiff inclusions compared to Bayesian Optimisation-based techniques. Experimental validation on a silicone phantom with embedded inclusions emulating pathological tissue regions further corroborates the potential of the method for autonomous tissue characterisation in diagnostic and screening applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[A Latency-Aware Framework for Visuomotor Policy Learning on Industrial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14255v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in contact-rich construction and manufacturing tasks that involve uncertainty and long-horizon execution. While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots.</p></details> |  |

Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, submitted to a Journal</p></details> |

To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface. The system facilitates efficient intraoperative setup and demonstrates potential for seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[System-Level Error Propagation and Tail-Risk Amplification in Reference-Based Robotic Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07846v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image guided robotic navigation systems often rely on reference based geometric perception pipelines, where accurate spatial mapping is established through multi stage estimation processes. In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Simultaneous State Estimation and Online Model Learning in a Soft Robotic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14092v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating complex real-world systems, such as soft robots, can benefit from precise predictive control schemes that require accurate state and model knowledge. This knowledge is typically not available in practical settings and must be inferred from noisy measurements. In particular, it is challenging to simultaneously estimate unknown states and learn a model online from sequentially arriving measurements. In this paper, we show how a recently proposed gray-box system identification tool enables the estimation of a soft robot's current pose while at the same time learning a bending stiffness model. For estimation and learning, we rely solely on a nominal constant-curvature robot model and measurements of the robot's base reactions (e.g., base forces). The estimation scheme -- relying on a marginalized particle filter -- allows us to conveniently interface nominal constant-curvature equations with a Gaussian Process (GP) bending stiffness model to be learned. This, in contrast to estimation via a random walk over stiffness values, enables prediction of bending stiffness and improves overall model quality. We demonstrate, using real-world soft-robot data, that the method learns a bending stiffness model online while accurately estimating the robot's pose. Notably, reduced multi-step forward-prediction errors indicate that the learned bending-stiffness GP improves overall model quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[RoboAug: One Annotation to Hundreds of Scenes via Region-Contrastive Data Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14032v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks. Our project is available at https://x-roboaug.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We argue that this decoupling is a fundamental bottleneck, masking the critical dependencies between high-level dispatching and low-level congestion. Existing simulators fail to bridge this gap, often abstracting away heterogeneous kinematics and stochastic execution failures. We propose WareRover, a holistic simulation platform that enforces a tight coupling between OS and MAPF via a unified, closed-loop optimization interface. Unlike standard benchmarks, WareRover integrates dynamic order streams, physics-aware motion constraints, and non-nominal recovery mechanisms into a single evaluation loop. Experiments reveal that SOTA algorithms often falter under these realistic coupled constraints, demonstrating that WareRover provides a necessary and challenging testbed for robust, next-generation warehouse coordination.

| **[Vision-Based Early Fault Diagnosis and Self-Recovery for Strawberry Harvesting Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02085v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping/misgrasp, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis.Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold.To mitigate empty grasping/misgrasp and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp classification during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2026</p></details> |

A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended abstract of this article is accepted for presentation at AAMAS 2026: Olivares-Alarcos, A., Muhammad, A., Sanjaya, S., Lin, H. and Alenyà, G.

In aiming for more complex tasks, especially those incorporating multimodal data, one hurdle continuing to prevent their realization is an inability to orchestrate multiple networks on neuromorphic hardware without resorting to off-chip process management logic. To address this, we show a first example of a pipeline for vision-based robot control in which numerous complex networks can be run entirely on hardware via the use of a spiking neural state machine for process orchestration. The pipeline is validated on the Intel Loihi 2 research chip. We show that all components can run concurrently on-chip in the milli Watt regime at latencies competitive with the state-of-the-art. An equivalent network on simulated hardware is shown to accomplish robotic arm plug insertion in simulation, and the core elements of the pipeline are additionally tested on a real robotic arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>IOP J...</summary><p>IOP Journal of Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering, preliminary acceptance</p></details> |

This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward more reliable and safer robotic surgical systems through computational vision enhancement.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2026 |

Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> |  |

Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations.

While tactile feedback is intuitively valuable, existing studies have shown that naïve visuo-tactile fusion often fails to deliver consistent improvements. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for visuo-tactile fusion that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.</p></details> | Accepted By ICRA2026 |

However, trained on general internet data, LLMs are not inherently aligned with the embodiment, skill sets, and limitations of real-world robotic systems. Inspired by the emerging paradigm of verbal reinforcement learning-where LLM agents improve through self-reflection and few-shot learning without parameter updates-we introduce PragmaBot, a framework that enables robots to learn task planning through real-world experience. PragmaBot employs a vision-language model (VLM) as the robot's "brain" and "eye", allowing it to visually evaluate action outcomes and self-reflect on failures. These reflections are stored in a short-term memory (STM), enabling the robot to quickly adapt its behavior during ongoing tasks. Upon task completion, the robot summarizes the lessons learned into its long-term memory (LTM). When facing new tasks, it can leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to plan more grounded action sequences by drawing on relevant past experiences and knowledge. Experiments on four challenging robotic tasks show that STM-based self-reflection increases task success rates from 35% to 84%, with emergent intelligent object interactions. In 12 real-world scenarios (including eight previously unseen tasks), the robot effectively learns from the LTM and improves single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, with RAG outperforming naive prompting. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of PragmaBot. Project webpage: https://pragmabot.github.io/</p></details> | Accepted to RA-L |
| **[Hierarchical Audio-Visual-Proprioceptive Fusion for Precise Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13640v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.</p></details> |  |

The system comprises three layers: a Forum Layer providing asynchronous, persistent, multi-agent interaction; an Agent Layer with forum agents that poll for @mention-targeted commands; and a Robot Layer with VLM-driven controllers and Unitree Go2/G1 hardware that translate commands into robot primitives via iterative tool calling. The framework supports multiple concurrent agents with distinct identities and physical embodiments coexisting in the same forum, establishing the feasibility of forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://yswi.github.io/tactalign/</p></details> |

An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://huajian-zeng.github.io/projects/flowhoi/</p></details> |
| **[Robots that Evolve with Us: Modular Co-Design for Personalization, Adaptability, and Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11622v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many current robot designs prioritize efficiency and one-size-fits-all solutions, oftentimes overlooking personalization, adaptability, and sustainability. To explore alternatives, we conducted two co-design workshops with 23 participants, who engaged with a modular robot co-design framework. Using components we provided as building blocks, participants combined, removed, and invented modules to envision how modular robots could accompany them from childhood through adulthood and into older adulthood. The participants' designs illustrate how modularity (a) enables personalization through open-ended configuration, (b) adaptability across shifting life-stage needs, and (c) sustainability through repair, reuse, and continuity. We therefore derive design principles that establish modularity as a foundation for lifespan-oriented human-robot interaction. This work reframes modular robotics as a flexible and expressive co-design approach, supporting robots that evolve with people, rather than static products optimized for single moments or contexts of use.</p></details> | Pre-print |

This interface has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses. Here, we measure human limb-device interaction via fluidic innervation, creating a 3D-printed silicone pad with embedded air channels to measure forces. As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered. Pad pressure tracked squat phase and overall task dynamics consistently. Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction. In the long-term, this modality may provide an alternative real-time sensing input to control / optimize wearable robotic systems and to capture user function during device use.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to BioRob 2026</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Human Emotion-Mediated Soft Robotic Arts: Exploring the Intersection of Human Emotions, Soft Robotics and Arts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13163v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotics has emerged as a versatile field with applications across various domains, from healthcare to industrial automation, and more recently, art and interactive installations. The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.</p></details> |  |

As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

In this paper, we present an agentic control system in which a reasoning-capable language model plans and executes tasks by selecting and invoking robot skills within an iterative planner and executor loop. We deploy the system on two physical robot platforms in two settings: (i) tabletop grasping, placement, and box insertion in indoor mobile manipulation (Mobipick) and (ii) autonomous agricultural navigation and sensing (Valdemar). Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline. Ablation studies further demonstrate the role of tactile force estimates and inertial feedback in stabilizing locomotion, with performance improvements of up to 56% compared to configurations without sensory feedback.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the presence of model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances. There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding internal audio sensing to internal vision enables human-like in-hand fabric recognition with soft robotic fingertips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12918v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguishing the feel of smooth silk from coarse cotton is a trivial everyday task for humans. When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.</p></details> |  |

Existing frameworks for educa-tional technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expecta-tions.</p></details> |  |

Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment.

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages with 2 figures of main content. 2 pages of References. 10 pages of appendix with 6 figures</p></details> |

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has received little attention. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MATEO: A Multimodal Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Planning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14589v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top-Down Semantic Refinement for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22391v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replanning Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks with Vision-Language Models via Semantic and Physical Dual-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14551v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Error Patterns in Historical OCR: A Comparative Analysis of TrOCR and a Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14524v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis. While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2D: Selective Spectral Decay for Quantization-Friendly Conditioning of Neural Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14432v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models pose a fundamental challenge to model quantization, creating excessively large ranges that cause severe accuracy drops during quantization. We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Turn Adaptive Prompting Attack on Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14399v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.</p></details> |  |

While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets. These results demonstrate that LQA offers a practical pathway for robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient VLM deployment on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures ,9 tables, preprint</p></details> |

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 24 Figures, 19 Tables</p></details> |

Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAP: Language-Action Pre-Training Enables Zero-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10556v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://lap-vla.github.io</p></details> |

However, this "pre-ingestion" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is "Index for locating, not understanding"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the "QA accuracy" problem into a "page localization" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning about the Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks. To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, along with annotated legal references and explanations written by human experts. We implement and assess retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models across tasks, including Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance. At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum passing grades required for driving exams. We highlight the potential and limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying autonomous agents in real-world settings remains challenging, primarily due to site heterogeneity, where generalist models lack domain-specific priors for diverse interfaces, and long-horizon instability, characterized by the accumulation of decision drift over extended interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce ColorBrowserAgent (Complex Long-Horizon Browser Agent), a knowledge-evolving agent for robust web automation. Our approach addresses these challenges through two synergistic mechanisms: human-in-the-loop knowledge adaptation that transforms sparse human feedback into reusable domain knowledge, and knowledge-aligned progressive summarization that stabilizes long interactions through memory compression. Extensive experiments on WebArena, WebChoreArena and industrial deployment show that ColorBrowserAgent consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of 71.2% on WebArena and maintains 47.4% performance under zero-shot transfer setting on WebChoreArena. In commercial deployment, it improves user satisfaction by 19.3% relatively, verifying its robustness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose DeCo (Task Decomposition and Skill Composition), a model-agnostic framework that enhances zero-shot generalization to compositional long-horizon manipulation tasks. DeCo decomposes IL demonstrations into modular atomic tasks based on gripper-object interactions, creating a dataset that enables models to learn reusable skills. At inference, DeCo uses a vision-language model (VLM) to parse high-level instructions, retrieve relevant skills, and dynamically schedule their execution. A spatially-aware skill-chaining module ensures smooth, collision-free transitions between skills. We introduce DeCoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization in long-horizon manipulation tasks. DeCo improves the success rate of three IL models, RVT-2, 3DDA, and ARP, by 66.67%, 21.53%, and 57.92%, respectively, on 12 novel tasks. In real-world experiments, the DeCo-enhanced model, trained on only 6 atomic tasks, completes 9 novel tasks in zero-shot, with a 53.33% improvement over the baseline model.

MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models.

Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 11,396 unique Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. Through the extensive evaluation on seven multimodal retrievers and fifteen VLMs, RAVENEA reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) In general, cultural grounding annotations can enhance multimodal retrieval and corresponding downstream tasks. (ii) VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, generally outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by averaging +6% on cVQA and +11% on cIC). (iii) Performance of culture-aware retrieval augmented varies widely across countries. These findings highlight the limitations of current multimodal retrievers and VLMs, underscoring the need to enhance visual culture understanding within RAG systems. We believe RAVENEA offers a valuable resource for advancing research on retrieval-augmented visual culture understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026; Project page: https://jiaangli.github.io/ravenea/</p></details> |

It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.</p></details> |  |

Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities.

However, trained on general internet data, LLMs are not inherently aligned with the embodiment, skill sets, and limitations of real-world robotic systems. Inspired by the emerging paradigm of verbal reinforcement learning-where LLM agents improve through self-reflection and few-shot learning without parameter updates-we introduce PragmaBot, a framework that enables robots to learn task planning through real-world experience. PragmaBot employs a vision-language model (VLM) as the robot's "brain" and "eye", allowing it to visually evaluate action outcomes and self-reflect on failures. These reflections are stored in a short-term memory (STM), enabling the robot to quickly adapt its behavior during ongoing tasks. Upon task completion, the robot summarizes the lessons learned into its long-term memory (LTM). When facing new tasks, it can leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to plan more grounded action sequences by drawing on relevant past experiences and knowledge. Experiments on four challenging robotic tasks show that STM-based self-reflection increases task success rates from 35% to 84%, with emergent intelligent object interactions. In 12 real-world scenarios (including eight previously unseen tasks), the robot effectively learns from the LTM and improves single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, with RAG outperforming naive prompting. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of PragmaBot. Project webpage: https://pragmabot.github.io/</p></details> | Accepted to RA-L |

Driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation, maintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses, enabling seamless human-machine interaction and dynamic service adaptation. Currently, AI agents are primarily built upon cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several challenges hinder their efficient deployment, including high service latency and a risk of sensitive data leakage during perception and processing. In this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent construction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs), as agent infrastructures, first create agent modules in a distributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI agents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent services for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of willingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a two-period dynamic contract model to continuously incentivize ESs to participate in agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information asymmetry between the cloud server and ESs. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Diffusion Model-based Soft Actor-Critic (EDMSAC) algorithm to effectively generate optimal dynamic contracts. In the algorithm, we apply dynamic structured pruning to DM-based actor networks to enhance denoising efficiency and policy learning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the EDMSAC algorithm outperforms the DMSAC algorithm by up to $23\%$ in optimal dynamic contract generation.</p></details> |  |

It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know When to Abstain: Optimal Selective Classification with Likelihood Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15008v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines, indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/clear-nus/sc-likelihood-ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpAgent: Operator Agent for Web Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13559v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models like CLIP have popularized this task by embedding multiple modalities into a joint space, developers still lack tools that reveal how these multimodal prompts interact with embedding spaces and why small wording changes can dramatically alter the results. We present InfoCIR, a visual analytics system that closes this gap by coupling retrieval, explainability, and prompt engineering in a single, interactive dashboard. InfoCIR integrates a state-of-the-art CIR back-end (SEARLE arXiv:2303.15247) with a six-panel interface that (i) lets users compose image + text queries, (ii) projects the top-k results into a low-dimensional space using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for spatial reasoning, (iii) overlays similarity-based saliency maps and gradient-derived token-attribution bars for local explanation, and (iv) employs an LLM-powered prompt enhancer that generates counterfactual variants and visualizes how these changes affect the ranking of user-selected target images. A modular architecture built on Plotly-Dash allows new models, datasets, and attribution methods to be plugged in with minimal effort. We argue that InfoCIR helps diagnose retrieval failures, guides prompt enhancement, and accelerates insight generation during model development. All source code allowing for a reproducible demo is available at https://github.com/giannhskp/InfoCIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+2 p...</summary><p>9+2 pages, 8 figures.

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 tables.

For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2026.

Existing dietary assessment methods largely rely on single-image analysis or appearance-based inference, including recent vision-language models, which lack explicit geometric reasoning and are sensitive to scale ambiguity. This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions. Experimental results show that while strong vision--language baselines achieve competitive performance, geometry-based reconstruction methods provide both improved accuracy and greater robustness, with the top-performing approach achieving 0.21 MAPE in volume estimation and 5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance in geometric accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to 2026 IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation.

| **[Training-Free Acceleration for Document Parsing Vision-Language Model with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12957v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document parsing is a fundamental task in multimodal understanding, supporting a wide range of downstream applications such as information extraction and intelligent document analysis. Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks. We will release our code to facilitate reproducibility and future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version of an ongoing project; the paper will be refined and extended in subsequent revisions</p></details> |

We present Roadscapes, a multitask multimodal dataset consisting of upto 9,000 images captured in diverse Indian driving environments, accompanied by manually verified bounding boxes. To facilitate scalable scene understanding, we employ rule-based heuristics to infer various scene attributes, which are subsequently used to generate question-answer (QA) pairs for tasks such as object grounding, reasoning, and scene understanding. The dataset includes a variety of scenes from urban and rural India, encompassing highways, service roads, village paths, and congested city streets, captured in both daytime and nighttime settings. Roadscapes has been curated to advance research on visual scene understanding in unstructured environments. In this paper, we describe the data collection and annotation process, present key dataset statistics, and provide initial baselines for image QA tasks using vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking Like a Radiologist: A Dataset for Anatomy-Guided Interleaved Vision Language Reasoning in Chest X-ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12843v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-SYS: A Reference Architecture for Interactive Explanation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12748v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explainable AI (XAI) research community has proposed numerous technical methods, yet deploying explainability as systems remains challenging: Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain explanation usability across repeated queries, evolving models and data, and governance constraints. We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SteerVLA: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models in Long-Tail Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08440v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that it enables real-world mapless navigation on a Spot robot using only signs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for a conference</p></details> |

Existing fairness-aware datasets have significantly improved demographic balance across global race and gender groups, yet they continue to treat Indian as a single monolithic category. The oversimplification ignores the vast intra-national diversity across 28 states and 8 Union Territories of India and leads to representational and geographical bias. To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent. Our work establishes IndicFairFace as the first benchmark to study geographical bias in VLMs for the Indian context.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro.

We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06130v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Compact LLM Deployment and World Model Assisted Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13628v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Snapshot Sensing to Persistent EM World Modeling: A Generative-Space Perspective for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13554v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic (EM) world modeling is emerging as a foundational capability for environment-aware and embodiment-enabled wireless systems. However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures/tables</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 0 figures.

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised JEPA-based World Models for LiDAR Occupancy Completion and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12540v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving, as an agent operating in the physical world, requires the fundamental capability to build \textit{world models} that capture how the environment evolves spatiotemporally in order to support long-term planning. At the same time, scalability demands learning such models in a self-supervised manner; \textit{joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA)} enables learning world models via leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data without relying on expensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AD-LiST-JEPA}, a self-supervised world model for autonomous driving that predicts future spatiotemporal evolution from LiDAR data using a JEPA framework. We evaluate the quality of the learned representations through a downstream LiDAR-based occupancy completion and forecasting (OCF) task, which jointly assesses perception and prediction. Proof of concept experiments show better OCF performance with pretrained encoder after JEPA-based world model learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.Code and videos: https://lift-humanoid.github.io</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

For these systems it is valuable to anticipate how a bin will look from the current observations and the planned stow behavior before real execution. We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Observer Effect in World Models: Invasive Adaptation Corrupts Latent Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12218v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.</p></details> |  |

While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page:https://pku-epic.github.io/LDA</p></details> |

In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Robotic Reinforcement Learning with Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11978v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning. Code and run artifacts are available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/DINO-MBQuant.</p></details> | Workshop submission |
| **[Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10983v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://haic-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> |

While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.</p></details> | 43 pages, ICLR 2026 |
| **[Budget-Constrained Agentic Large Language Models: Intention-Based Planning for Costly Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11541v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for training in operational systems or computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators, e.g., reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or learned world models, can cheaply provide useful data, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), a sample-efficient RL framework that mixes scarce target-environment data with a control variate formed from abundant low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a practical, multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. Under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence to locally optimal policies in the target environment and achieves faster finite-sample convergence than standard REINFORCE. We evaluate MFPG on robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. When low-fidelity data are neutral or beneficial and dynamics gaps are mild-moderate, MFPG is, among the evaluated off-dynamics RL and low-fidelity-only approaches, the only method that consistently achieves statistically significant improvements over a high-fidelity-only baseline. When low-fidelity data become harmful, MFPG exhibits the strongest robustness, whereas strong off-dynamics RL methods exploit low-fidelity data aggressively and fail much more severely. An additional experiment with anti-correlated high- and low-fidelity rewards shows MFPG can remain effective even under reward misspecification. MFPG thus offers a reliable paradigm for exploiting cheap low-fidelity data (e.g., for efficient sim-to-real transfer) while managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11389v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

| **[H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

| **[Agent World Model: Infinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10090v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/kai0-rl/</p></details> |

| **[ResWorld: Temporal Residual World Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10884v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

When such models rely on complex simulators, evaluating the likelihood is typically intractable, making traditional inference methods such as MCMC inapplicable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by training deep generative models to approximate the posterior distribution over parameters using simulated data. In this work, we consider the tall data setting, where multiple independent observations provide additional information, allowing sharper posteriors and improved parameter identifiability. Building on the flourishing score-based diffusion literature, F-NPSE (Geffner et al., 2023) estimates the tall data posterior by composing individual scores from a neural network trained only for a single context observation. This enables more flexible and simulation-efficient inference than alternative approaches for tall datasets in SBI. However, it relies on costly Langevin dynamics during sampling. We propose a new algorithm that eliminates the need for Langevin steps by explicitly approximating the diffusion process of the tall data posterior. Our method retains the advantages of compositional score-based inference while being significantly faster and more stable than F-NPSE. We demonstrate its improved performance on toy problems and standard SBI benchmarks, and showcase its scalability by applying it to a complex real-world model from computational neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 24 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms, 12 appendices, TMLR acceptance</p></details> |

Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://world-arena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Despite substantial progress in deepfake detection models, their real-world effectiveness is often undermined by evolving distribution shifts between training and test data, driven by the complexity of human speech and the rapid evolution of synthesis systems. Existing datasets suffer from limited real speech diversity, insufficient coverage of recent synthesis systems, and heterogeneous mixtures of deepfake sources, which hinder systematic evaluation and open-world model training. To address these issues, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale and highly diverse deepfake audio dataset comprising over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders, totalling 3 million clips. We further observe that most existing detectors default to binary supervised training, which can induce negative transfer across synthesis sources when the training data contains highly diverse deepfake patterns, impacting overall generalisation. As a complementary contribution, we propose an effective curriculum-learning-based approach to mitigate this effect. Extensive experiments show that existing detection models struggle to generalise to novel deepfakes and human speech in AUDETER, whereas XLR-based detectors trained on AUDETER achieve strong cross-domain performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an EER of 1.87% on In-the-Wild. AUDETER is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.</p></details> |  |

Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected "social world models" rather than isolated competencies. This work contributes novel ToM localizer data, methodological refinements to functional localization techniques, and empirical insights into the emergence of social cognition in artificial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, under review</p></details> |

While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://showlab.github.io/Olaf-World/ Code: https://github.com/showlab/Olaf-World</p></details> |

We introduce Optimistic World Models (OWMs), a principled and scalable framework for optimistic exploration that brings classical reward-biased maximum likelihood estimation (RBMLE) from adaptive control into deep RL. In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures. We instantiate OWMs within two state-of-the-art world model architectures, leading to Optimistic DreamerV3 and Optimistic STORM, which demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and cumulative return compared to their baseline counterparts.</p></details> |  |
