| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models must enable agents to execute long-horizon tasks under partial observability. However, most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. While semantic grounding is important, long-horizon manipulation fundamentally requires persistent, action-conditioned state representations. Current VLAs lack such representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once per task, the VLM provides high-level intent, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5 percent and 37.5 percent higher success rates on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to pi_0. It also reduces inference latency by up to five times relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5 percent without belief to 77.5 percent with belief.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuantVLA: Scale-Calibrated Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20309v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models unify perception, language, and control for embodied agents but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to rapidly increasing compute and memory demands, especially as models scale to longer horizons and larger backbones. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.</p></details> | CVPR2026 |
| **[World Guidance: World Modeling in Condition Space for Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22010v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.

| **[Joint-Aligned Latent Action: Towards Scalable VLA Pretraining in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21736v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are limited by a scarcity of large-scale, diverse robot data. While human manipulation videos offer a rich alternative, existing methods are forced to choose between small, precisely-labeled datasets and vast in-the-wild footage with unreliable hand tracking labels. We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data. We scale this approach with UniHand-Mix, a 7.5M video corpus (>2,000 hours) blending laboratory and in-the-wild footage. Experiments demonstrate that JALA generates more realistic hand motions in both controlled and unconstrained scenarios, significantly improving downstream robot manipulation performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. These results indicate that jointly-aligned latent actions offer a scalable pathway for VLA pretraining from human data.</p></details> | CVPR2026 |
| **[PD-VLA: Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Model Integrated with Action Chunking via Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02310v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. The performance of VLA models can be improved by integrating with action chunking, a critical technique for effective control. However, action chunking linearly scales up action dimensions in VLA models with increased chunking sizes. This reduces the inference efficiency. To tackle this problem, we propose PD-VLA, the first parallel decoding framework for VLA models integrated with action chunking. Our framework reformulates autoregressive decoding as a nonlinear system solved by parallel fixed-point iterations. This approach preserves model performance with mathematical guarantees while significantly improving decoding speed. In addition, it enables training-free acceleration without architectural changes, as well as seamless synergy with existing acceleration techniques. Extensive simulations validate that our PD-VLA maintains competitive success rates while achieving 2.52 times execution frequency on manipulators (with 7 degrees of freedom) compared with the fundamental VLA model. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the most effective settings for acceleration. Finally, real-world experiments validate its high applicability across different tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025, updated results on LIBERO</p></details> |
| **[Self-Correcting VLA: Online Action Refinement via Sparse World Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21633v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on fitting statistical data priors, limiting their robust understanding of underlying physical dynamics. Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

| **[LiLo-VLA: Compositional Long-Horizon Manipulation via Linked Object-Centric Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21531v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots must master long-horizon manipulation, defined as tasks involving multiple kinematic structure changes (e.g., attaching or detaching objects) in unstructured environments. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%. Project page: https://yy-gx.github.io/LiLo-VLA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[EO-1: An Open Unified Embodied Foundation Model for General Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21112v5)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, we introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.

| **[VLA Knows Its Limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21445v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action chunking has recently emerged as a standard practice in flow-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, the effect and choice of the execution horizon - the number of actions to be executed from each predicted chunk - remains underexplored. In this work, we first show that varying the execution horizon leads to substantial performance deviations, with performance initially improving and then declining as the horizon increases. To uncover the reasons, we analyze the cross- and self-attention weights in flow-based VLAs and reveal two key phenomena: (i) intra-chunk actions attend invariantly to vision-language tokens, limiting adaptability to environmental changes; and (ii) the initial and terminal action tokens serve as stable anchors, forming latent centers around which intermediate actions are organized. Motivated by these insights, we interpret action self-attention weights as a proxy for the model's predictive limit and propose AutoHorizon, the first test-time method that dynamically estimates the execution horizon for each predicted action chunk to adapt to changing perceptual conditions. Across simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, AutoHorizon is performant, incurs negligible computational overhead, and generalizes across diverse tasks and flow-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://hatchetproject.github.io/autohorizon/</p></details> |
| **[NoRD: A Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model that Drives without Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21172v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with \modelname (\textbf{No} \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{D}riving). Compared to existing VLAs, \modelname achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on $<$60\% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3$\times$ fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. \modelname overcomes this by incorporating Dr.~GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, \modelname achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[ActionReasoning: Robot Action Reasoning in 3D Space with LLM for Robotic Brick Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21161v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical robotic systems typically rely on custom planners designed for constrained environments. While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |
| **[HALO: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Embodied Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21157v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation, but often struggle in long-horizon or out-of-distribution scenarios due to the lack of explicit mechanisms for multimodal reasoning and anticipating how the world will evolve under action. Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Notes-to-Self: Scratchpad Augmented VLAs for Memory Dependent Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21013v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many dexterous manipulation tasks are non-markovian in nature, yet little attention has been paid to this fact in the recent upsurge of the vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. Although they are successful in bringing internet-scale semantic understanding to robotics, existing VLAs are primarily "stateless" and struggle with memory-dependent long horizon tasks. In this work, we explore a way to impart both spatial and temporal memory to a VLA by incorporating a language scratchpad. The scratchpad makes it possible to memorize task-specific information, such as object positions, and it allows the model to keep track of a plan and progress towards subgoals within that plan. We evaluate this approach on a split of memory-dependent tasks from the ClevrSkills environment, on MemoryBench, as well as on a challenging real-world pick-and-place task. We show that incorporating a language scratchpad significantly improves generalization on these tasks for both non-recurrent and recurrent models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fast-ThinkAct: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Verbalizable Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09708v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026.

| **[IG-RFT: An Interaction-Guided RL Framework for VLA Models in Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20715v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential for generalist robotic policies; however, they struggle to generalize to long-horizon complex tasks in novel real-world domains due to distribution shifts and the scarcity of high-quality demonstrations. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037v4)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision-Language-Actionf(VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust BYOVLA that requires external LLMs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. On the real-world FR5 robot, under four types of multimodal perturbations, RobustVLA shows strong low-data performance, outperforming pi0 by 65.6% success rate with 25 demonstrations. Even with abundant demos, our method still outperform pi0 by 30% success rate. Code and demo videos available at https://github.com/gakakulicc/RobustVLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Explainable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20577v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An interactive enhanced driving dataset for autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20575v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of autonomous driving towards full automation demands robust interactive capabilities; however, the development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is constrained by the sparsity of interactive scenarios and inadequate multimodal alignment in existing data. To this end, this paper proposes the Interactive Enhanced Driving Dataset (IEDD). We develop a scalable pipeline to mine million-level interactive segments from naturalistic driving data based on interactive trajectories, and design metrics to quantify the interaction processes. Furthermore, the IEDD-VQA dataset is constructed by generating synthetic Bird's Eye View (BEV) videos where semantic actions are strictly aligned with structured language. Benchmark results evaluating ten mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs) are provided to demonstrate the dataset's reuse value in assessing and fine-tuning the reasoning capabilities of autonomous driving models.</p></details> |  |
| **[BFA++: Hierarchical Best-Feature-Aware Token Prune for Multi-View Vision Language Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20566v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to jointly interpret instructions and visual inputs. However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the π0 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[UniLACT: Depth-Aware RGB Latent Action Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20231v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent action representations learned from unlabeled videos have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for pretraining vision-language-action (VLA) models without explicit robot action supervision. However, latent actions derived solely from RGB observations primarily encode appearance-driven dynamics and lack explicit 3D geometric structure, which is essential for precise and contact-rich manipulation. To address this limitation, we introduce UniLACT, a transformer-based VLA model that incorporates geometric structure through depth-aware latent pretraining, enabling downstream policies to inherit stronger spatial priors. To facilitate this process, we propose UniLARN, a unified latent action learning framework based on inverse and forward dynamics objectives that learns a shared embedding space for RGB and depth while explicitly modeling their cross-modal interactions. This formulation produces modality-specific and unified latent action representations that serve as pseudo-labels for the depth-aware pretraining of UniLACT. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-aware unified latent action representations. UniLACT consistently outperforms RGB-based latent action baselines under in-domain and out-of-domain pretraining regimes, as well as on both seen and unseen manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manishgovind.github.io/unilact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Universal Pose Pretraining for Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19710v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns. To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALOE: Action-Level Off-Policy Evaluation for Vision-Language-Action Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12691v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

| **[Mantis: A Versatile Vision-Language-Action Model with Disentangled Visual Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16175v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.</p></details> |  |

However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data, TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to state-of-the-art model $π_0$, which relies on extensive proprietary bimanual data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 (Poster).

Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness and efficiency on structured, long-horizon manipulation tasks remain unclear. In this work, we present a head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model π0 and a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control. We evaluate both approaches on structured variants of the Towers of Hanoi manipulation task in simulation while measuring both task performance and energy consumption during training and execution. On the 3-block task, the neuro-symbolic model achieves 95% success compared to 34% for the best-performing VLA. The neuro-symbolic model also generalizes to an unseen 4-block variant (78% success), whereas both VLAs fail to complete the task. During training, VLA fine-tuning consumes nearly two orders of magnitude more energy than the neuro-symbolic approach. These results highlight important trade-offs between end-to-end foundation-model approaches and structured reasoning architectures for long-horizon robotic manipulation, emphasizing the role of explicit symbolic structure in improving reliability, data efficiency, and energy efficiency.

It typically comprising a Vision-Language backbone for perception and understanding, together with a generative policy for action generation. However, its performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the action generation proceess. (i) Low inference efficiency. A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard. In Real-World evaluation, OptimusVLA ranks best on Generalization and Long-horizon suites, surpassing pi_0 by 42.9% and 52.4%, respectively, while delivering 2.9x inference speedup.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Habilis-$β$: A Fast-Motion and Long-Lasting On-Device Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18813v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Habilis-$β$, a fast-motion and long-lasting on-device vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for real-world deployment. Current VLA evaluation remains largely confined to single-trial success rates under curated resets, which fails to capture the fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities essential for practical operation. To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, Habilis-$β$ achieves 572.6 TPH and 39.2 s MTBI (vs. 120.5 TPH and 30.5 s for $π_{0.5}$), while in a real-world humanoid logistics workflow it achieves 124 TPH and 137.4 s MTBI (vs. 19 TPH and 46.1 s for $π_{0.5}$). Finally, Habilis-$β$ achieves the highest reported performance on the standard RoboTwin 2.0 leaderboard across representative tasks, validating its effectiveness in complex manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Demystifying VLA Inference Performance with VLA-Perf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18397v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimVLA: A Simple VLA Baseline for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18224v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations.

Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, Project Page: https://dravenalg.github.io/VLANeXt/</p></details> |

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as "key-value memory", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, naïve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models. The code and model weights can be found at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/ROCKET-VLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Vision Overrides Language: Evaluating and Mitigating Counterfactual Failures in VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-va.github.io/</p></details> |

While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation, attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits its applicability in real-time robotic systems. Existing approaches accelerate sampling in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting techniques originally developed to speed up image generation. However, a major distinction exists: image generation typically produces independent samples without temporal dependencies, while robotic manipulation requires generating action trajectories with continuity and temporal coherence. To this end, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. Concretely, we introduce a frequency consistency constraint objective that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on 40 tasks of LIBERO. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency of 93.5 Hz.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap." We first characterize the test-time scaling laws for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce CoVer-VLA, a hierarchical test-time verification pipeline using the trained verifier. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses the verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer-VLA achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dreamzero0.github.io/</p></details> |

However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $π_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to reflect the final accepted version published in Neurocomputing</p></details> |

Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness.

| **[Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $π_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $π_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://lap-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Semantic-Contact Fields for Category-Level Generalizable Tactile Tool Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13833v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors. To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTIF: Learning Action Motifs for Few-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13764v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings. Code is available at https://github.com/buduz/MOTIF.</p></details> |  |
| **[HBVLA: Pushing 1-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13710v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |

This versatility allows them to achieve speed and energy-efficiency on smooth terrain and agility over rough terrain. Inspired by these athletes, we present the design and control of a robotic platform, Ultra Mobility Vehicle (UMV), which combines a bicycle and a reaction mass to move dynamically with minimal actuated degrees of freedom. We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 11 figures, 3 movies, 2 tables</p></details> |

In addition, connectors must be inserted with limited force to avoid damage, while their poses can vary significantly. While humans can do this task intuitively by combining visual and haptic feedback, programming an industrial robot for such a task in an adaptable manner remains difficult. This work presents an empirical study investigating the suitability of behavioral cloning for learning an action prediction model for connector insertion that fuses force-torque sensing with a fixed position camera. We compare several network architectures and other design choices using a dataset of up to 300 successful human demonstrations collected via teleoperation of a UR5e robot with a SpaceMouse under varying connector poses. The resulting system is then evaluated against five different connector geometries under varying connector poses, achieving an overall insertion success rate of over 90 %.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present FlowCorrect, a deployment-time correction framework that converts near-miss failures into successes using sparse human nudges, without full policy retraining. During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios. The results demonstrate clearly that FlowCorrect learns only with very few demonstrations and enables fast and sample-efficient incremental, human-in-the-loop corrections of generative visuomotor policies at deployment time in real-world robotics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

These robots exhibit complex mechanics that pose diverse challenges in modeling and control. Among various models, continuum mechanical models based on rod theories can effectively capture the deformations of slender bodies in contact-rich scenarios. This structured review paper focuses on the role of rod models in continuum and soft robot control with a vertical approach. We provide a comprehensive summary of the mathematical background underlying the four main rod theories applied in soft robotics and their variants. Then, we review the literature on rod models applied to continuum and soft robots, providing a novel categorization in deformation classes. Finally, we survey recent model-based and learning-based control strategies leveraging rod models, highlighting their potential in real-world manipulation. We critically discuss the trends, advantages, limitations, research gaps, and possible future developments of rod models. This paper aims to guide researchers who intend to simulate and control new soft robots while providing feedback to the design and manufacturing community.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we provide an overview of the impact that foundation models and transformer networks have had on these different levels, bringing robots closer than ever to "full-stack transfer". Considering LLMs, VLMs and VLAs from a robotic transfer learning perspective allows us to highlight recurring concepts for transfer, beyond specific implementations. We also consider the challenges of data collection and transfer benchmarks for robotics in the age of foundation models. Are foundation models the route to full-stack transfer in robotics? Our expectation is that they will certainly stay on this route as a key technology.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, enabling humanoid robots to perform natural and context-appropriate gaze shifts in unconstrained human--robot interaction (HRI) remains challenging, as it requires the coupling of cognitive attention mechanisms and biomimetic motion generation. In this work, we propose the Robot Gaze-Shift (RGS) framework, which integrates these two components into a unified pipeline. First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors. Experiments validate that RGS effectively replicates human-like target selection and generates realistic, diverse gaze-shift motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to AIM 2026</p></details> |

However, previous methods are severely limited by treating each transfer as an isolated endeavor, demanding repeated, costly tuning and wasting prior transfer experience. To move beyond isolated sim-to-real, we build a continual cross-task sim-to-real transfer paradigm centered on knowledge accumulation across iterative transfers, thereby enabling effective and efficient adaptation to novel tasks. Thus, we propose GeCo-SRT, a geometry-aware continual adaptation method. It utilizes domain-invariant and task-invariant knowledge from local geometric features as a transferable foundation to accelerate adaptation during subsequent sim-to-real transfers. This method starts with a geometry-aware mixture-of-experts module, which dynamically activates experts to specialize in distinct geometric knowledge to bridge observation sim-to-real gap. Further, the geometry-expert-guided prioritized experience replay module preferentially samples from underutilized experts, refreshing specialized knowledge to combat forgetting and maintain robust cross-task performance. Leveraging knowledge accumulated during iterative transfer, GeCo-SRT method not only achieves 52% average performance improvement over the baseline, but also demonstrates significant data efficiency for new task adaptation with only 1/6 data. We hope this work inspires approaches for efficient, low-cost cross-task sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Crucially dependent on resilient mobile network connectivity, they serve as invaluable assets for tasks like rapid victim localization and the exploration of hazardous, otherwise unreachable areas. However, their reliance on battery power and the need for persistent, low-latency communication limit operational time and mobility. To address this, and considering the evolving capabilities of 5G/6G networks, we propose a novel SAR framework that includes Mission Planning and Mission Execution phases and that optimizes robot deployment. By considering parameters such as the exploration area size, terrain elevation, robot fleet size, communication-influenced energy profiles, desired exploration rate, and target response time, our framework determines the minimum number of robots required and their optimal paths to ensure effective coverage and timely data backhaul over mobile networks. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs between number of robots, explored area, and response time for wheeled and quadruped robots. Further, we quantify the impact of terrain elevation data on mission time and energy consumption, showing the benefits of incorporating real-world environmental factors that might also affect mobile signal propagation and connectivity into SAR planning. This framework provides critical insights for leveraging next-generation mobile networks to enhance autonomous SAR operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.09177</p></details> |

However, existing open-source articulated-object datasets for simulation are limited by insufficient visual realism and low physical fidelity, which hinder their utility for training models mastering robotic tasks in real world. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtVIP, a comprehensive open-source dataset comprising high-quality digital-twin articulated objects, accompanied by indoor-scene assets. Crafted by professional 3D modelers adhering to unified standards, ArtVIP ensures visual realism through precise geometric meshes and high-resolution textures, while physical fidelity is achieved via fine-tuned dynamic parameters. Meanwhile, the dataset pioneers embedded modular interaction behaviors within assets and pixel-level affordance annotations. Feature-map visualization and optical motion capture are employed to quantitatively demonstrate ArtVIP's visual and physical fidelity, with its applicability validated across imitation learning and reinforcement learning experiments.

Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments.

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings. MALLVI presents a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed-loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVI generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step. Rather than using a single model, MALLVI coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.

Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces. However, existing works often overlook the role of representations in achieving generalization of a manipulation policy in the complex input space during the hand-object interaction. In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2026</p></details> |

Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction. Future work should assess its usability and efficacy for clinical populations in restoring clinicians' sense of agency during robot-assisted therapy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework with Prompt Optimization for Multi-Robot Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21670v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot task planning requires decomposing natural-language instructions into executable actions for heterogeneous robot teams. Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively. An ablation study shows that the hierarchical structure, prompt optimization, and meta-prompt sharing contribute roughly +59, +37, and +4 percentage points to the overall success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2026. 8 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

This paper develops a mini-sized wheeled-legged robot for agile motion and presents a novel motion control framework that integrates the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for locomotion and the Differential Evolution (DE) based trajectory optimization for jumping in quadrupedal wheeled-legged robots. The proposed controller utilizes wheel motion and locomotion to enhance jumping performance, achieving versatile maneuvers such as vertical jumping, forward jumping, and backflips. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating a forward jump over a 0.12 m obstacle and a vertical jump reaching 0.5 m.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, we introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Generation of Explanations for Robot Policies with Weighted Signal Temporal Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21841v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</p></details> |  |

Vehicles must maneuver safely near animals and fragile structures while coping with currents, variable illumination and limited sensing. Previous approaches simplify these problems by leveraging soft materials and bioinspired swimming designs, but such platforms remain limited in terms of deployable autonomy. Here we present a sea turtle-inspired autonomous underwater robot that closed the gap between bioinspired locomotion and field-ready autonomy through a tightly integrated, vision-driven control stack. The robot combines robust depth-heading stabilization with obstacle avoidance and target-centric control, enabling it to track and interact with moving objects in complex terrain. We validate the robot in controlled pool experiments and in a live coral reef exhibit at the New England Aquarium, demonstrating stable operation and reliable tracking of fast-moving marine animals and human divers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated biomimetic robotic system, combining novel hardware, control, and field experiments, deployed to track and monitor real marine animals in their natural environment. During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode. Together, these results establish a practical route toward soft-rigid hybrid, bioinspired underwater robots capable of minimally disruptive exploration and close-range monitoring in sensitive ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 5 supplementary figures, 1 supplementary table.

Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

Traditional simulators based on first-principles, however, typically require full-state observability or depend on parameter search for system identification. This work presents \texttt{CableRobotGraphSim}, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for cable-driven robots that aims to address shortcomings of prior simulation solutions. By representing cable-driven robots as graphs, with the rigid-bodies as nodes and the cables and contacts as edges, this model can quickly and accurately match the properties of other simulation models and real robots, while ingesting only partially observable inputs. Accompanying the GNN model is a sim-and-real co-training procedure that promotes generalization and robustness to noisy real data. This model is further integrated with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller for closed-loop navigation, which showcases the model's speed and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Complementarity-Based Contact Modeling and Planning for Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21316v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots were introduced in large part to enable safe, adaptive interaction with the environment, and this interaction relies fundamentally on contact. However, modeling and planning contact-rich interactions for soft robots remain challenging: dense contact candidates along the body create redundant constraints and rank-deficient LCPs, while the disparity between high stiffness and low friction introduces severe ill-conditioning. Existing approaches rely on problem-specific approximations or penalty-based treatments. This letter presents a unified complementarity-based framework for soft-robot contact modeling and planning that brings contact modeling, manipulation, and planning into a unified, physically consistent formulation. We develop a robust Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) model tailored to discretized soft robots and address these challenges with a three-stage conditioning pipeline: inertial rank selection to remove redundant contacts, Ruiz equilibration to correct scale disparity and ill-conditioning, and lightweight Tikhonov regularization on normal blocks. Building on the same formulation, we introduce a kinematically guided warm-start strategy that enables dynamic trajectory optimization through contact using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) and demonstrate its effectiveness on contact-rich ball manipulation tasks. In conclusion, CUSP provides a new foundation for unifying contact modeling, simulation, and planning in soft robotics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot. We train policies for 15 minutes on a single RTX 3090 GPU, with most tasks converging in under 6 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>For w...</summary><p>For website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/squint</p></details> |

While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

In EDID, robots are allowed to exchange information only upon meeting. Crucially, EDID assumes that the robots are not allowed to schedule their meetings. As such, the robots have no means to anticipate when, where, and who they will meet. As a step towards the design of storage and routing algorithms for EDID, in this paper we propose a model of information diffusion that captures the essential dynamics of EDID. The model is derived from first principles and is composed of two levels: a micro model, based on a generalization of the concept of `mean free path'; and a macro model, which captures the global dynamics of information diffusion. We validate the model through extensive robot simulations, in which we consider swarm size, communication range, environment size, and different random motion regimes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this model on the algorithms that best support information diffusion according to the parameters of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published at ANTS 2026</p></details> |

Systematic scanning is difficult due to time-consuming per-sample testing and the high-dimensional parameter space affecting performance. To address this, we propose an optimization pipeline enabled by a novel testing robot capable of scanning DEA lifetime. The robot integrates electro-mechanical property measurement, programmable voltage input, and multi-channel testing capacity. Using it, we scanned the lifetime of Elastosil-based linear actuators across parameters including input voltage magnitude, frequency, electrode material concentration, and electrical connection filler. The optimal parameter combinations improved operational lifetime under boundary operating conditions by up to 100% and were subsequently scaled up to achieve higher force and displacement output. The final product demonstrated resilience on a modular, scalable quadruped walking robot with payload carrying capacity (>100% of its untethered body weight, and >700% of combined actuator weight). This work is the first to introduce a self-driving lab approach into robotic actuator design.</p></details> |  |

We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer that captures contact deformations optically, turning foot-ground interactions into rich haptic signals. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose (position and orientation), visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of the contact patch. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. These findings suggest that integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

Existing methods, employ a variety of open-loop and closed-loop approaches but lack an end-to-end solution that can grasp several objects while taking into account the downstream task's constraints. Our proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance task-oriented grasping, prioritizing the post-grasp intention of the agent. We extract human grasp preferences from the ContactPose dataset, and train a hand synergy model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to imitate the participant's grasping actions. Based on this data, we train an agent able to grasp multiple objects while taking into account distinct post-grasp intentions that are task-specific. By combining data-driven insights from human grasping behavior with learning by exploration provided by reinforcement learning, we can develop humanoid robots capable of context-aware manipulation actions, facilitating collaboration in human-centered environments.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for advancing robotic capabilities in dynamic environments. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories under complex dynamics, and it necessitates intelligent control strategies to ensure precise ball striking to target regions. High-speed object manipulation typically demands advanced visual perception hardware capable of capturing rapid motion with exceptional temporal resolution. Drawing inspiration from Kahneman's dual-system theory, where fast intuitive processing complements slower deliberate reasoning, there exists an opportunity to develop more robust perception architectures that can handle high-speed dynamics while maintaining accuracy. To this end, we present \textit{\textbf{SpikePingpong}}, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. We develop a Fast-Slow system architecture where System 1 provides rapid ball detection and preliminary trajectory prediction with millisecond-level responses, while System 2 employs spike-oriented neural calibration for precise hittable position corrections. For strategic ball striking, we introduce Imitation-based Motion Planning And Control Technology, which learns optimal robotic arm striking policies through demonstration-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{\textbf{SpikePingpong}} achieves a remarkable 92\% success rate for 30 cm accuracy zones and 70\% in the more challenging 20 cm precision targeting. This work demonstrates the potential of Fast-Slow architectures for advancing robotic capabilities in time-critical manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we aim to develop a system that can recognize its surroundings and identify target objects while in motion, enabling it to plan and execute actions accordingly. We propose a periodic sampling-based whole-body trajectory planning method, called the "Robot Local Planner (RLP)." This method leverages unique features of home environments to enhance computational efficiency, motion optimality, and robustness against recognition and control errors, all while ensuring safety. The RLP minimizes computation time by planning with minimal waypoints and generating safe trajectories. Furthermore, overall motion optimality is improved by periodically executing trajectory planning to select more optimal motions. This approach incorporates inverse kinematics that are robust to base position errors, further enhancing robustness. Evaluation experiments demonstrated that the RLP outperformed existing methods in terms of motion planning time, motion duration, and robustness, confirming its effectiveness in home environments.

In contrast, robotic grinding systems typically rely on force sensing, with acoustic information largely ignored. This reliance on force sensors is costly and difficult to adapt to different grinding tools, whereas audio sensors (microphones) are low-cost and can be mounted on any medium that conducts grinding sound. This paper introduces a low-cost Acoustic Feedback Robotic Grinding System (AFRG) that captures audio signals with a contact microphone, estimates grinding force from the audio in real time, and enables closed-loop force control of the grinding process. Compared with conventional force-sensing approaches, AFRG achieves a 4-fold improvement in consistency across different grinding disc conditions. AFRG relies solely on a low-cost microphone, which is approximately 200-fold cheaper than conventional force sensors, as the sensing modality, providing an easily deployable, cost-effective robotic grinding solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026. 8 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating semantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

These robots often incorporate deep learning (DL) components into their software to support functionality such as perception, decision-making, and control, enhancing autonomy and self-adaptability. However, the inherent uncertainty of DL-enabled software makes it challenging to ensure its dependability in dynamic environments. Consequently, test generation techniques have been developed to test robot software, and classical mutation analysis injects faults into the software to assess the test suite's effectiveness in detecting the resulting failures. However, there is a lack of mutation analysis techniques to assess the effectiveness under the uncertainty inherent to DL-enabled software. To this end, we propose UAMTERS, an uncertainty-aware mutation analysis framework that introduces uncertainty-aware mutation operators to explicitly inject stochastic uncertainty into DL-enabled robotic software, simulating uncertainty in its behavior. We further propose mutation score metrics to quantify a test suite's ability to detect failures under varying levels of uncertainty. We evaluate UAMTERS across three robotic case studies, demonstrating that UAMTERS more effectively distinguishes test suite quality and captures uncertainty-induced failures in DL-enabled software.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Previous approaches to continuum robot state estimation typically rely on simplified, deterministic actuation models. In contrast, our method jointly estimates robot shape, external loads, internal stresses, and actuation inputs. We adopt a discrete Cosserat rod formulation and show that, when paired with a midpoint integration rule, it achieves high numerical accuracy with relatively few state nodes. This discretization naturally induces a factor-graph structure for sparse nonlinear optimization on SE(3). We extend the formulation with actuation factors for tendon-driven robots and combine multiple rod graphs for parallel continuum robots with closed-loop topologies. By explicitly including actuation variables in the state, the linearized system can be reused to extract manipulator Jacobians, which we leverage in performing trajectory tracking. Finally, we validate the approach experimentally on a surgical concentric tube robot. Overall, our approach enables principled, real-time estimation across multiple continuum robot architectures, accounting for actuation uncertainty and providing direct access to manipulator Jacobians.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Public preprint for IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead.

Unlike rigid wings, deformable counterparts can alter their aerodynamic properties on demand. Improvements in hydrodynamic efficiency extend a UUV's operational range and may determine mission feasibility. Structural and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for both a soft morphing wing and a UUV incorporating it. The results show that a UUV employing soft wings achieves 9.75 percent higher overall efficiency than an equivalent vehicle with traditional rigid wings. These findings confirm the potential of soft robotics to enhance underwater vehicle performance, particularly in applications requiring pressure-agnostic operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper accepted at 9th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Memory-Efficient 2D/3D Shape Assembly of Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26518v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as a representative class of methods for robot swarm shape assembly. They rely on image-based target-shape representations to compute local density gradients and perform mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such representations incur substantial memory overhead, especially for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient tree representation that hierarchically encodes user-specified shapes in both 2D and 3D. Based on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller for assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm show one to two orders of magnitude lower memory usage and two to four times faster shape entry. Physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs further validate real-world practicality.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a brain-robot control framework for offline decoding of driving commands during robotic rover operation. A 4WD Rover Pro platform was remotely operated by 12 participants who navigated a predefined route using a joystick, executing the commands forward, reverse, left, right, and stop. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded with a 16-channel OpenBCI cap and aligned with motor actions at Delta = 0 ms and future prediction horizons (Delta > 0 ms). After preprocessing, several deep learning models were benchmarked, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer architectures. ShallowConvNet achieved the highest performance for both action prediction and intent prediction. By combining real-world robotic control with multi-horizon EEG intention decoding, this study introduces a reproducible benchmark and reveals key design insights for predictive deep learning-based BCI systems.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory representations are parameterized as linear combinations of orthogonal basis functions, and optimization is performed directly in the coefficient space. The constrained problem formulation consists of both an objective functional and a finite-dimensional objective defined over truncated coefficients. To address nonlinearity, FACTO uses a Gauss-Newton approximation with exponential moving averaging, yielding a smoothed quadratic subproblem. Trajectory-wide constraints are addressed using coefficient-space mappings, and an adaptive constrained update using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is performed in the null space of active constraints. Comparisons with optimization-based planners (CHOMP, TrajOpt, GPMP2) and sampling-based planners (RRT-Connect, RRT*, PRM) show the improved solution quality and feasibility, especially in constrained single- and multi-arm scenarios. The experimental evaluation of FACTO on Franka robots verifies the feasibility of deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Much Ado About Noising: Dispelling the Myths of Generative Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01809v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding, each with multi-modal time series data and several anomalies. Several autoencoderbased methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different robotic tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, the paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Athena: An Autonomous Open-Hardware Tracked Rescue Robot Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19898v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In disaster response and situation assessment, robots have great potential in reducing the risks to the safety and health of first responders. As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles. The manipulator with a maximum reach of 1.54m can be used to operate doors, valves, and other objects of interest. Full CAD & PCB files, as well as all low-level software, are released as open-source contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/athena</p></details> |

A key challenge lies in achieving reliable autonomous in-motion physical coupling of two mobile ground robots starting at any initial position. Existing approaches neglect the modeling of the docking interface and the strategy for approaching it, resulting in uncontrolled collisions that make in-motion physical coupling either impossible or inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose a central mpc approach that explicitly models the dynamics and states of two omnidirectional wheeled robots, incorporates constraints related to their docking interface, and implements an approaching strategy for rendezvous and docking. This novel approach enables omnidirectional wheeled robots with a docking interface to physically couple in motion regardless of their initial position. In addition, it makes in-motion transfer possible, which is 19.75% more time- and 21.04% energy-efficient compared to a non-coupling approach in a logistic scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, conference paper</p></details> |

While vision-based soft tactile sensors can track internal marker displacements, learning-based models for 3D contact estimation heavily depend on their training datasets, inherently limiting their ability to generalize to complex scenarios such as multi-point sensing. To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm. By successfully extrapolating complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, this methodology unlocks advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Ultimately, it significantly streamlines the development of marker-based soft sensors, offering a highly scalable solution for real-world tactile perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted at 9th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |

This work presents a novel multimodal HRI framework that combines advanced vision-language models, speech processing, and fuzzy logic to enable precise and adaptive control of a Dobot Magician robotic arm. The proposed system integrates Florence-2 for object detection, Llama 3.1 for natural language understanding, and Whisper for speech recognition, providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface for object manipulation through spoken commands. By jointly addressing scene perception and action planning, the approach enhances the reliability of command interpretation and execution. Experimental evaluations conducted on consumer-grade hardware demonstrate a command execution accuracy of 75\%, highlighting both the robustness and adaptability of the system. Beyond its current performance, the proposed architecture serves as a flexible and extensible foundation for future HRI research, offering a practical pathway toward more sophisticated and natural human-robot collaboration through tightly coupled speech and vision-language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint currently under revision</p></details> |

Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLaDA-MedV, the first large language diffusion model tailored for biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV achieves relative performance gains of 7.855% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867% over LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks: 84.93% on VQA-RAD, 92.31% on SLAKE, and 95.15% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.</p></details> |  |

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingfengren/NoLan.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/lingfengren/NoLan</p></details> |
| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models must enable agents to execute long-horizon tasks under partial observability. However, most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. While semantic grounding is important, long-horizon manipulation fundamentally requires persistent, action-conditioned state representations. Current VLAs lack such representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once per task, the VLM provides high-level intent, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5 percent and 37.5 percent higher success rates on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to pi_0. It also reduces inference latency by up to five times relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5 percent without belief to 77.5 percent with belief.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoDiv: Framework For Measuring Geographical Diversity In Text-To-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22120v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior works compensate with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlook the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

We developed \textbf{Brain3D}, a staged vision-language framework for automated radiology report generation from 3D brain tumor MRI. Our approach inflates a pretrained 2D medical encoder into a native 3D architecture and progressively aligns it with a causal language model through three stages: contrastive grounding, supervised projector warmup, and LoRA-based linguistic specialization. Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility</p></details> |  |

However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2026; Project Page: https://robustvisrag.github.io</p></details> |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling humanoid robots to perform natural and context-appropriate gaze shifts in unconstrained human--robot interaction (HRI) remains challenging, as it requires the coupling of cognitive attention mechanisms and biomimetic motion generation. In this work, we propose the Robot Gaze-Shift (RGS) framework, which integrates these two components into a unified pipeline. First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors. Experiments validate that RGS effectively replicates human-like target selection and generates realistic, diverse gaze-shift motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to AIM 2026</p></details> |

We propose PRioritized cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data- and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned. Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress, prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods, PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a scalable solution for efficient learning.</p></details> | CVPR 2026 |

Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning.

| **[JailBound: Jailbreaking Internal Safety Boundaries of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19610v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks. However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios.</p></details> | CVPR 2026 |
| **[Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer; OpenAI) answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available: https://github.com/TruhnLab/VisionSemanticEntropy</p></details> |

However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks. We show that with only 100 real training samples, our framework achieves on average $87\%$ of the performance of the full real-world dataset. We publicly release our code and 140k+ synthetic document samples.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings. MALLVI presents a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed-loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVI generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step. Rather than using a single model, MALLVI coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.

Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures.

Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates: small change in interpretability percentage for Qwen-based variants we trained (pre-processing fix), clarification in Section 3 on our method (after feedback from readers), additional appendix section</p></details> |

While previous works have proposed various benchmarks to evaluate this issue, the quality of these evaluations remains unverified. We observe that some of these benchmarks may produce inconsistent evaluation results across repeated tests or fail to align with human evaluation. To address this, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages specific indicators to assess both reliability and validity. Our empirical analysis using HQM reveals and pinpoints potential evaluation issues in existing benchmarks, exposing a critical gap in current hallucination evaluation. To bridge this gap, we propose HQH, a High-Quality Hallucination benchmark, which demonstrates superior reliability and validity under HQM, serving as a credible evaluation tool. Our large-scale evaluation of popular LVLMs on HQH reveals severe hallucination problems, which occur not only in the models' main answer to a question but also in additional analysis. This highlights the necessity for future model improvements to effectively mitigate hallucinations and reduce the associated security risks in real-world applications. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/HQHBench/HQHBench.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the increasing demand for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial token counts, consequently leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby improving computational efficiency without architectural changes. Through extensive analysis, we identify two critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods: positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which critically hinder their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first approach from a dynamic token variation perspective, revealing that visual token variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}), which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks consistently demonstrate that V$^2$Drop maintains \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original performance for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026.

Existing AI systems offer binary safety verification or static detection, ignoring the phase-dependent nature of intraoperative reasoning. We introduce ResGo, a benchmark of laparoscopic frames annotated with Go Zone bounding boxes and clinician-authored rationales covering phase, exposure quality reasoning, next action and risk reminder. We introduce evaluation metrics that treat correct grounding under incorrect phase as failures, revealing that most vision-language models cannot handle such tasks and perform poorly. We then present SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture where the model first identifies the surgical phase, then generates reasoning and Go Zone coordinates conditioned on that context. On unseen procedures, SurGo-R1 achieves 76.6% phase accuracy, 32.7 mIoU, and 54.8% hardcore accuracy, a 6.6$\times$ improvement over the mainstream generalist VLMs. Code, model and benchmark will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurGo-R1</p></details> |  |

Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach significantly enhances model performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the entire reasoning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is an error happening in Figure 1, because Figure 1 did not perfectly show the exact overview of the PRISM pipeline</p></details> |

One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, Under review</p></details> |

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making. The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, using LLMs/VLMs for this task is challenging: the CAD model metadata sequences often exceed token budgets, and fine-tuning high-performing proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini) is unavailable. Therefore, we need a framework that delivers engineering value by handling long, non-natural-language CAD model metadata using VLMs, but without training. We propose a 2-stage framework with inference-time adaptation that combines corrected Error Notebooks with RAG to substantially improve VLM-based part retrieval reasoning. Each Error Notebook is built by correcting initial CoTs through reflective refinement, and then filtering each trajectory using our proposed grammar-constraint (GC) verifier to ensure structural well-formedness. The resulting notebook forms a high-quality repository of specification-CoT-answer triplets, from which RAG retrieves specification-relevant exemplars to condition the model's inference. We additionally contribute a CAD dataset with human preference annotations. Experiments with proprietary models (GPT-4o, Gemini, etc) show large gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to +23.4 absolute accuracy points on the human-preference benchmark. The proposed GC verifier can further produce up to +4.5 accuracy points. Our approach also surpasses other training-free baselines (standard few-shot learning, self-consistency) and yields substantial improvements also for open-source VLMs (Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, Aya-Vision-8B). Under the cross-model GC setting, where the Error Notebook is constructed using GPT-4o (Omni), the 2B model inference achieves performance that comes within roughly 4 points of GPT-4o mini.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to "think with images" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.</p></details> | CVPR2026 Accepted |

Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as consistent within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding and offer both interpretability and practical improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively.

The framework operationalises cultural understanding through five levels (L1--L5) and 165 culture-specific dimensions across six traditions: Tier I computes automated quality indicators, Tier II applies rubric-based single-judge scoring, and Tier III calibrates the aggregate score to human expert ratings via sigmoid calibration. Applied to 15 VLMs across 294 evaluation pairs, the validated instrument reveals that (i) automated metrics and judge scoring measure different constructs, establishing single-judge calibration as the more reliable alternative; (ii) cultural understanding degrades from visual description (L1--L2) to cultural interpretation (L3--L5); and (iii) Western art samples consistently receive higher scores than non-Western ones. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-cultural evaluation instrument for generative art critique, providing a reproducible methodology for auditing VLM cultural competence.

| **[Synergizing Understanding and Generation with Interleaved Analyzing-Drafting Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21435v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation.

| **[PSF-Med: Measuring and Explaining Paraphrase Sensitivity in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21428v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision Language Models (VLMs) can change their answers when clinicians rephrase the same question, which raises deployment risks. We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21406v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) requires dividing videos into action segments, yet the vast space of activities and alternative breakdowns makes collecting comprehensive datasets infeasible. Existing methods remain limited to closed vocabularies and fixed label sets. In this work, we explore the largely unexplored problem of Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Temporal Action Segmentation (OVTAS) by leveraging the strong zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce a training-free pipeline that follows a segmentation-by-classification design: Frame-Action Embedding Similarity (FAES) matches video frames to candidate action labels, and Similarity-Matrix Temporal Segmentation (SMTS) enforces temporal consistency. Beyond proposing OVTAS, we present a systematic study across 14 diverse VLMs, providing the first broad analysis of their suitability for open-vocabulary action segmentation. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that OVTAS achieves strong results without task-specific supervision, underscoring the potential of VLMs for structured temporal understanding.</p></details> | ICRA 2026 |
| **[MMLoP: Multi-Modal Low-Rank Prompting for Efficient Vision-Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21397v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has become a dominant paradigm for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to downstream tasks without modifying pretrained weights. While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \textbf{MMLoP} (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Lo}w-Rank \textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\% on base-to-novel generalization.</p></details> |  |

Built on a flow-based architecture, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation. Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment, with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than [Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code, pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the next generation of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Survey on Responsible Generative AI for a Sustainable Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08650v6)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is rapidly moving from research to deployment, elevating the need for responsible development, evaluation, and governance. We conduct a PRISMA guided review of 232 studies (November 2022 - December 2025), spanning large language models, vision language models, diffusion models, and agentic pipelines. We make four contributions: (1) the first survey bridging governance principles, technical evaluation, and domain deployment across all four system types; (2) a ten-criterion rubric (C1-C10) scoring major AI safety benchmarks on risk-surface coverage, paired with a policy crosswalk mapping benchmarks to regulatory requirements; (3) twelve lifecycle KPIs, explainability guidance for foundation models, and a testbed catalogue; and (4) domain-specific analysis across healthcare, finance, education, arts, agriculture, and defense. Three findings emerge: benchmark coverage is dense for bias and toxicity but sparse for privacy, provenance, deepfakes, and system-level failures in agentic settings; evaluations remain largely static and task local, limiting audit portability; and inconsistent documentation complicates cross-release comparison. We outline a research agenda prioritizing adaptive multimodal evaluation, privacy and provenance testing, deepfake risk assessment, calibration reporting, versioned artifacts, and continuous monitoring. This survey offers a structured path to align generative AI evaluation with governance needs for safe and accountable deployment</p></details> | under review |
| **[Contextual Safety Reasoning and Grounding for Open-World Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19983v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly operating in open-world environments where safe behavior depends on context: the same hallway may require different navigation strategies when crowded versus empty, or during an emergency versus normal operations. Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

| **[Spa3R: Predictive Spatial Field Modeling for 3D Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21186v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Through Words: Controlling Visual Retrieval Quality with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21175v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image retrieval is a fundamental task in vision-language learning, yet in real-world scenarios it is often challenged by short and underspecified user queries. Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |
| **[VAUQ: Vision-Aware Uncertainty Quantification for LVLM Self-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21054v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently hallucinate, limiting their safe deployment in real-world applications. Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR-Agent: Agentic OCR with Capability and Memory Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21053v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential on complex visual understanding tasks through iterative optimization methods.However, these models generally lack effective self-correction mechanisms, making it difficult for them to independently rectify cognitive biases. Consequently, during multi-turn revisions, they often fall into repetitive and ineffective attempts, failing to achieve stable improvements in answer quality.To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative self-correction framework that endows models with two key capabilities: Capability Reflection and Memory Reflection. This framework guides the model to first diagnose errors and generate a correction plan via Capability Reflection, then leverage Memory Reflection to review past attempts to avoid repetition and explore new solutions, and finally, optimize the answer through rigorous re-reasoning. Experiments on the challenging OCRBench v2 benchmark show that OCR-Agent outperforms the current open-source SOTA model InternVL3-8B by +2.0 on English and +1.2 on Chinese subsets, while achieving state-of-the-art results in Visual Understanding (79.9) and Reasoning (66.5) - surpassing even larger fine-tuned models. Our method demonstrates that structured, self-aware reflection can significantly enhance VLMs' reasoning robustness without additional training.

Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models.

Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches. Experiments show that CLIP equipped with CLIPGlasses achieves competitive in-domain performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain generalization. Its superiority is especially evident under low-resource conditions, indicating stronger robustness across domains.</p></details> |  |

Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

We introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous, and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines. Through open-sourcing our system and models, we hope to lay the groundwork for a new generation of multi-agent world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://solaris-wm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models must enable agents to execute long-horizon tasks under partial observability. However, most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. While semantic grounding is important, long-horizon manipulation fundamentally requires persistent, action-conditioned state representations. Current VLAs lack such representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once per task, the VLM provides high-level intent, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5 percent and 37.5 percent higher success rates on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to pi_0. It also reduces inference latency by up to five times relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5 percent without belief to 77.5 percent with belief.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Guidance: World Modeling in Condition Space for Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22010v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.

Model-based RL (MBRL) addresses this by learning a world model to generate simulated experience, but standard approaches that rely on pixel-level reconstruction losses often fail to capture small, task-critical objects in complex, dynamic scenes. We posit that an object-centric (OC) representation can direct model capacity toward semantically meaningful entities, improving dynamics prediction and sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce OC-STORM, an object-centric MBRL framework that enhances a learned world model with object representations extracted by a pretrained segmentation network. By conditioning on a minimal number of annotated frames, OC-STORM learns to track decision-relevant object dynamics and inter-object interactions without extensive labeling or access to privileged information. Empirical results demonstrate that OC-STORM significantly outperforms the STORM baseline on the Atari 100k benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency on challenging boss fights in the visually complex game Hollow Knight. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating OC priors into MBRL for complex visual domains. Project page: https://oc-storm.weipuzhang.com</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior methods that handle spatial and temporal correlations separately, we propose RAYNOVA, a geometry-agonistic multiview world model for driving scenarios that employs a dual-causal autoregressive framework. It follows both scale-wise and temporal topological orders in the autoregressive process, and leverages global attention for unified 4D spatio-temporal reasoning. Different from existing works that impose strong 3D geometric priors, RAYNOVA constructs an isotropic spatio-temporal representation across views, frames, and scales based on relative Plücker-ray positional encoding, enabling robust generalization to diverse camera setups and ego motions. We further introduce a recurrent training paradigm to alleviate distribution drift in long-horizon video generation. RAYNOVA achieves state-of-the-art multi-view video generation results on nuScenes, while offering higher throughput and strong controllability under diverse input conditions, generalizing to novel views and camera configurations without explicit 3D scene representation.

Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted to Neurips 2025 Workshop Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations</p></details> |
| **[NRSeg: Noise-Resilient Learning for BEV Semantic Segmentation via Driving World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04002v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively.

| **[Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19698v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark on average. However, we discover that conventional aggregates mask a major problem, Performance Asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in certain tasks (Agent-Optimal tasks) while drastically underperform humans in other tasks (Human-Optimal tasks). Indeed, despite achieving SOTA in the overall mean Human-Normalized Scores (HNS), the SOTA agent scored the worst among baselines on Human-Optimal tasks, with a striking 21X performance gap between the Human-Optimal and Agent-Optimal subsets. To address this, we partition Atari100k evenly into Human-Optimal and Agent-Optimal subsets, and introduce a more balanced aggregate, Sym-HNS. Furthermore, we trace the striking Performance Asymmetry in the SOTA pixel diffusion world model to the curse of dimensionality and its prowess on high visual detail tasks (e.g. Breakout). To this end, we propose a novel latent end-to-end Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI) world model that achieves SOTA results in Sym-HNS, Human-Optimal tasks, and Breakout -- thus reversing the worsening Performance Asymmetry trend while improving computational efficiency and remaining competitive on the full Atari100k.</p></details> | Preprint |

We prove that every forward model in a broad, precisely defined operator class Cimg (encompassing clinical, scientific, and industrial imaging modalities, both linear and nonlinear) admits an epsilon-approximate representation as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are drawn from a library of exactly 11 canonical primitives: Propagate, Modulate, Project, Encode, Convolve, Accumulate, Detect, Sample, Disperse, Scatter, and Transform. We call this the Finite Primitive Basis Theorem. The proof is constructive: we provide an algorithm that, given any H in Cimg, produces a DAG G with relative operator error at most epsilon and graph complexity within prescribed bounds. We further prove that the library is minimal: removing any single primitive causes at least one modality to lose its epsilon-approximate representation. A systematic analysis of nonlinearities in imaging physics shows they fall into two structural categories: pointwise scalar functions (handled by Transform) and self-consistent iterations (unrolled into existing linear primitives). Empirical validation on 31 linear modalities confirms eimg below 0.01 with at most 5 nodes and depth 5, and we provide constructive DAG decompositions for 9 additional nonlinear modalities. These results establish mathematical foundations for the Physics World Model (PWM) framework.</p></details> |  |

Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://AdaWorldPolicy.github.io</p></details> |

Many of the basic ideas behind this revolution were published within the 12 months of our "Annus Mirabilis" 1990-1991 at our lab in TU Munich. Back then, few people were interested. But a quarter century later, NNs based on our "Miraculous Year" were on over 3 billion devices, and used many billions of times per day, consuming a significant fraction of the world's compute. In particular, in 1990-91, we laid foundations of Generative AI, publishing principles of (1) Generative Adversarial Networks for Artificial Curiosity and Creativity (now used for deepfakes), (2) Transformers (the T in ChatGPT - see the 1991 Unnormalized Linear Transformer), (3) Pre-training for deep NNs (see the P in ChatGPT), (4) NN distillation (key for DeepSeek), and (5) recurrent World Models for Reinforcement Learning and Planning in partially observable environments. The year 1991 also marks the emergence of the defining features of (6) LSTM, the most cited AI paper of the 20th century (based on deep residual learning and constant error flow through residual NN connections), and (7) the most cited paper of the 21st century, based on our LSTM-inspired Highway Net that was 10 times deeper than previous feedforward NNs. As of 2025, the two most frequently cited scientific articles of all time (with the most Google Scholar citations within 3 years - manuals excluded) are both directly based on our 1991 work.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, over 300 references, 38 illustrations, extending v1 of 4 Oct 2019</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Planning with Jumpy World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19634v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOCA-Bench: Beyond Semantic Perception to Predictive World Modeling via Hegelian Ontological-Causal Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19571v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Text-Guided Vision Model for Enhanced Recognition of Small Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19503v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Applied Computer Science (2026)</p></details> |
| **[MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19285v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DD0922/MRI-Contrast-Enhancement-Kinetics-World-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[K-Search: LLM Kernel Generation via Co-Evolving Intrinsic World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19128v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents via Environment Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847v4)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information from interaction that is available during deployment. First, an online syntactic alignment (SA) method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding (DG) method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with an in-context world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%. We release our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available here: https://github.com/r2llab/GTTA</p></details> |

However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026, 19 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07854v3)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning world models compress visual input into latent spaces, discarding the spatial structure that characterizes sensory cortex. We propose isomorphic world models: architectures preserving sensory topology so that physics prediction becomes geometric propagation rather than abstract state transition. We implement this using neural fields with motor-gated channels, where activity evolves through local lateral connectivity and motor commands multiplicatively modulate specific populations. Three experiments support this approach: (1) local connectivity is sufficient to learn ballistic physics, with predictions traversing intermediate locations rather than "teleporting"; (2) policies trained entirely in imagination transfer to real physics at nearly twice the rate of latent-space alternatives; and (3) motor-gated channels spontaneously develop body-selective encoding through visuomotor prediction alone. These findings suggest intuitive physics and body schema may share a common origin in spatially structured neural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v3)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in autonomous endovascular navigation, but generalization across 'long' navigation tasks remains challenging. We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature. While HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies, the simulation-to-real transition introduces challenges. Future work will refine RL strategies using world models and validate performance on unseen in vitro data, advancing autonomous MT towards clinical translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page here: https://codeysun.github.io/generated-reality</p></details> |
| **[AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |
| **[FRAPPE: Infusing World Modeling into Generalist Policies via Multiple Future Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17259v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling VLA models to predict environmental dynamics, known as world modeling, has been recognized as essential for improving robotic reasoning and generalization. However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://h-zhao1997.github.io/frappe</p></details> |

We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07463v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</p></details> |  |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/ccolas/language_and_experience Demo: cedriccolas.com/demos/language_and_experience</p></details> |
| **[Factored Latent Action World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16229v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Failure Classification and Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16182v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Model-Augmented Web Agents with Action Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06130v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Compact LLM Deployment and World Model Assisted Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13628v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
