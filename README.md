| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge, improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

| **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLM$_1$: A Boundless Large Model for Cross-Space, Cross-Task, and Cross-Embodiment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24161v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to See and Act: Task-Aware View Planning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05186v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

| **[RoboOmni: Proactive Robot Manipulation in Omni-modal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23763v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Urban Micromobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23576v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

It aims to provide a one-stop VLA research service for professionals in the field of embodied intelligence. It offers a codebase that supports multiple mainstream VLA policies simultaneously, allowing users to reproduce various VLA methods with just a single environment setup. The toolbox is experiment-centric, where the users can quickly develop new VLA experiments by simply modifying the Exp script. Moreover, we provide much stronger pretrained models to achieve great performance improvements for state-of-the-art VLA policies. Dexbotic will continuously update to include more of the latest pre-trained foundation models and cutting-edge VLA models in the industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/junjxiao/world-env.</p></details> |  |
| **[FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arms detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, object and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe</p></details> |
| **[AutoVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Reasoning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13757v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Website link:https://autovla.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Embodying Physical Computing into Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24692v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance, payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and present a perspective for future development.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeVI-SLAM: Gravity-Enhanced Stereo Visua Inertial SLAM for Underwater Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24533v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation. In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics. With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games: Strategic Planning in Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24515v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods. Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95% optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer linear programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Concurrent-Allocation Task Execution for Multi-Robot Path-Crossing-Minimal Navigation in Obstacle Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09230v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing undesirable path crossings among trajectories of different robots is vital in multi-robot navigation missions, which not only reduces detours and conflict scenarios, but also enhances navigation efficiency and boosts productivity. Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal (MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal squared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly. However, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual robot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is presented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle environments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot allocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle avoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained optimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible path crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the desired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints simultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can be achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of solutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE algorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation burden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and the control input directly without the path planning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Robot Cell Modeling via Exploratory Robot Motions: A Novel and Accessible Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01484v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating a collision-free robot motion is crucial for safe applications in real-world settings. This requires an accurate model of all obstacle shapes within the constrained robot cell, which is particularly challenging and time-consuming. The difficulty is heightened in flexible production lines, where the environment model must be updated each time the robot cell is modified. Furthermore, sensor-based methods often necessitate costly hardware and calibration procedures and can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g., light conditions or reflections). To address these challenges, we present a novel data-driven approach to modeling a cluttered workspace, leveraging solely the robot internal joint encoders to capture exploratory motions. By computing the corresponding swept volume (SV), we generate a (conservative) mesh of the environment that is subsequently used for collision checking within established path planning and control methods. Our method significantly reduces the complexity and cost of classical environment modeling by removing the need for computer-aided design (CAD) files and external sensors. We validate the approach with the KUKA LBR iisy collaborative robot in a pick-and-place scenario. In less than three minutes of exploratory robot motions and less than four additional minutes of computation time, we obtain an accurate model that enables collision-free motions. Our approach is intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users without specialized technical knowledge. It is applicable to all types of industrial robots or cobots.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DynaRend: Learning 3D Dynamics via Masked Future Rendering for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24261v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize 2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This work presents an in-depth review of RL principles, advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, and their integration into robotic and control systems. Beginning with the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the study outlines essential elements of the agent-environment interaction and explores core algorithmic strategies including actor-critic methods, value-based learning, and policy gradients. Emphasis is placed on modern DRL techniques such as DDPG, TD3, PPO, and SAC, which have shown promise in solving high-dimensional, continuous control tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced to categorize RL applications across domains such as locomotion, manipulation, multi-agent coordination, and human-robot interaction, along with training methodologies and deployment readiness levels. The review synthesizes recent research efforts, highlighting technical trends, design patterns, and the growing maturity of RL in real-world robotics. Overall, this work aims to bridge theoretical advances with practical implementations, providing a consolidated perspective on the evolving role of RL in autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, it has gained prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with $\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with fewer demonstrated tasks.

In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS.

We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict, LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%.

Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model. The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, Presented at the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Rome, July 2025</p></details> |

| **[Radar and Event Camera Fusion for Agile Robot Ego-Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18443v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

GRS creates digital twin simulations from single RGB-D observations with solvable tasks for virtual agent training. Using vision-language models (VLMs), our pipeline operates in three stages: 1) scene comprehension with SAM2 for segmentation and object description, 2) matching objects with simulation-ready assets, and 3) generating appropriate tasks. We ensure simulation-task alignment through generated test suites and introduce a router that iteratively refines both simulation and test code. Experiments demonstrate our system's effectiveness in object correspondence and task environment generation through our novel router mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive General Model of Tendon-Actuated Concentric Tube Robots with Multiple Tubes and Tendons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23954v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$ of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboOmni: Proactive Robot Manipulation in Omni-modal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23763v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Flexible Linear Objects in Planar Environments by Two Robot Hands Using Euler's Elastica Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02874v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manipulation of flexible objects such as cables, wires and fresh food items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents, called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and demonstrated with detailed examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotArena $\infty$: Scalable Robot Benchmarking via Real-to-Sim Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23571v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robotarenainf.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness in tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a high-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and a Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm. Notably, we find that five- or six-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to $10$ across all closed-loop control tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Localising under the drape: proprioception in the era of distributed surgical robotic system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23512v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers, providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions, supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

| **[iWalker: Imperative Visual Planning for Walking Humanoid Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18361v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots, designed to operate in human-centric environments, serve as a fundamental platform for a broad range of tasks. Although humanoid robots have been extensively studied for decades, a majority of existing humanoid robots still heavily rely on complex modular frameworks, leading to inflexibility and potential compounded errors from independent sensing, planning, and acting components. In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid sense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and footstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two imperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step planning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised learning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

However, most robotic assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time, enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human intents for open-ended and long-term HRC.

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To deliver these services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Biomimetic Intelligence and Robotics for possible publication</p></details> |

The aim of the present paper is to compare different sensors, to illustrate the process from detection to the finished collision environment and to detect collisions between the robot and this environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Tactile Sensing for Imitation Learning: A Case Study on Robotic Match Lighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13618v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of robotic manipulation has advanced significantly in recent years. At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, this integration has so far been underexplored, most notably in dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks where precision and reactivity are essential. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework that integrates a modular transformer architecture with a flow-based generative model, enabling efficient learning of fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and show that adding tactile information improves policy performance, thereby underlining their combined potential for learning dynamic manipulation from few demonstrations.

Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23204v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.</p></details> |  |

We address this with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency control under real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil. Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent. Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper by the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Robotic Task Execution in the Face of Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23121v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms. Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). 8 pages, 7 figures, IEEE two-column format</p></details> |

Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint notice, this manuscript has been submitted to IEEE sensors journal for possible publication</p></details> |

We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05020v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous multirobot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, existing methods that rely on static or task-specific models often lack generalizability across diverse tasks and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical multimodal framework that integrates a prompted large language model (LLM) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). At the system level, the LLM performs hierarchical task decomposition and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM provides semantic perception and object localization, where the proposed GridMask significantly enhances the VLM's spatial accuracy for reliable fine-grained manipulation. The aerial robot leverages this global map to generate semantic paths and guide the ground robot's local navigation and manipulation, ensuring robust coordination even in target-absent or ambiguous scenarios. We validate the framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments on long-horizon object arrangement tasks, demonstrating zero-shot adaptability, robust semantic navigation, and reliable manipulation in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic system that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning for global high-level task planning and execution.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

However, this introduces two challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique, resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 12 figures, Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[PIP-LLM: Integrating PDDL-Integer Programming with LLMs for Coordinating Multi-Robot Teams Using Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22784v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans. While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency. We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

| **[Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters, where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining a Unified PDDL Domain from Real-World Demonstrations for Generalizable Robot Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21545v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding. Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators, 2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and LLM-PDDL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Steerability Factors for Growing Vine Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22504v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip, enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body. Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward and horizontal curvatures.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July 2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review.

The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional \textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the \textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as \textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots. The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Continuum Robot Shape under External Loading using Spatiotemporal Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22339v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the 3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and 0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00538v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |
| **[Robust Understanding of Human-Robot Social Interactions through Multimodal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06278v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing need for social robots and intelligent agents that can effectively interact with and support users. For the interactions to be seamless, the agents need to analyse social scenes and behavioural cues from their (robot's) perspective. Works that model human-agent interactions in social situations are few; and even those existing ones are computationally too intensive to be deployed in real time or perform poorly in real-world scenarios when only limited information is available. We propose a knowledge distillation framework that models social interactions through various multimodal cues, and yet is robust against incomplete and noisy information during inference. We train a teacher model with multimodal input (body, face and hand gestures, gaze, raw images) that transfers knowledge to a student model which relies solely on body pose. Extensive experiments on two publicly available human-robot interaction datasets demonstrate that our student model achieves an average accuracy gain of 14.75% over competitive baselines on multiple downstream social understanding tasks, even with up to 51% of its input being corrupted. The student model is also highly efficient - less than 1% in size of the teacher model in terms of parameters and its latency is 11.9% of the teacher model.

In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand. We release the code and additional results on our website.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Research evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

| **[Mano Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17336v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.</p></details> |  |

While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/Video-SafetyBench.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++.

Investigating multimodal in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with CLIP and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24321v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.</p></details> | <details><summary>www.w...</summary><p>www.walidbousselham.com/VOLD/</p></details> |

Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in real-world LEO satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS. Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art methods, without compromising inference accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[V-SAT: Video Subtitle Annotation Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24180v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization, incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT (Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of ~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle annotation.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP. By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization, outperforming competing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner. It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue, just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and make faster, more confident diagnoses.</p></details> |  |

HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods.

| **[CalFuse: Multi-Modal Continual Learning via Feature Calibration and Parameter Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18672v8)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of multi-modal data in large-scale visual recognition systems, enabling models to continuously acquire knowledge from evolving data streams while preserving prior information has become increasingly critical. Class-Continual Learning (CCL) addresses this challenge by incrementally incorporating new class knowledge without revisiting historical data, making it essential for real-world big data applications. While traditional CCL methods rely solely on visual features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate significant potential for CCL by leveraging pre-trained multi-modal knowledge. However, existing approaches face challenges in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the cross-modal generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose CalFuse, a framework that synergizes feature Calibration with parameter Fusion to enable effective multi-modal knowledge integration in continual learning scenarios. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that adaptively balances original CLIP visual representations with task-specific features, preserving the model's intrinsic cross-modal generalization while adapting to new classes. Concurrently, a QR decomposition-based parameter fusion strategy progressively integrates newly acquired knowledge with historical task parameters, maintaining equilibrium between learning new class representations and retaining prior knowledge across sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale multi-modal continual learning settings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both average accuracy and final task retention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

Effective perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav. Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation (HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the navigation performance.</p></details> | under review |

Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to reason with both language and visual data. Although many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes, they often require high computational cost, rely on object-centric approaches, or depend on environmental priors in detailed human instructions. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a training-free framework that harnesses open-source VLMs to enable robots to navigate effectively, even for human-friendly language goal such as abstract places, actions, or specific objects in open scenes. NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior. We evaluated and validated NavVLM in both simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) on object-specifc tasks in richly detailed environments from Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Gibson. With navigation episode reported, NavVLM demonstrates the capabilities to navigate towards any open-set languages. In real-world validation, we validated our framework's effectiveness in real-world robot at indoor scene.</p></details> | under review |

While such models have gained significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders, and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science.

In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.</p></details> |  |

Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16% human-validated accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$compared to 57.6% on a dataset generated by recent work. Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration. Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.</p></details> | NV-Reason-CXR-3B |

However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We present an explainable image authenticity detection system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier ("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify, localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5% accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11654v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</p></details> |  |

Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robotarenainf.github.io</p></details> |

A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

| **[On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/junjxiao/world-env.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18700v4)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Video Is Not Worth a Thousand Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23253v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering (VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

| **[Process Reward Models for Sentence-Level Verification of LVLM Radiology Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23217v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach: a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence, conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance, relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to internal activations</p></details> |  |
| **[DecoDINO: 3D Human-Scene Contact Prediction with Semantic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23203v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii) halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/DavidePasero/deco/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Finding 3D Scene Analogies with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23184v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FM4RoboPlan workshop at RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attention! Your Vision Language Model Could Be Maliciously Manipulated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19911v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under peer review</p></details> |

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arms detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, object and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks.

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |

| **[Evolving Diagnostic Agents in a Virtual Clinical Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24654v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.</p></details> |  |
