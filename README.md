| **[TIC-VLA: A Think-in-Control Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02459v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

| **[World-Gymnast: Training Robots with Reinforcement Learning in a World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02454v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning from interacting with the physical world is fundamentally bottlenecked by the cost of physical interaction. The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[MAIN-VLA: Modeling Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02212v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in Visual-Language-Action (VLA), in highly complex and dynamic environments that involve real-time unpredictable interactions (such as 3D open worlds and large-scale PvP games), existing approaches remain inefficient at extracting action-critical signals from redundant sensor streams. To tackle this, we introduce MAIN-VLA, a framework that explicitly Models the Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment to ground decision-making in deep semantic alignment rather than superficial pattern matching. Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance. Extensive experiments in open-world Minecraft and large-scale PvP environments (Game for Peace and Valorant) demonstrate that MAIN-VLA sets a new state-of-the-art, which achieves superior decision quality, stronger generalization, and cutting-edge inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FD-VLA: Force-Distilled Vision-Language-Action Model for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02142v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Force sensing is a crucial modality for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, as it enables fine-grained perception and dexterous manipulation in contact-rich tasks. We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24795v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world interaction. Despite their remarkable performance, foundational VLAs are hindered by the prohibitive computational and data demands inherent to their large-scale architectures. While a surge of recent research has focused on enhancing VLA efficiency, the field lacks a unified framework to consolidate these disparate advancements. To bridge this gap, this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire model-training-data pipeline. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design, focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3) Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications, delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments: https://evla-survey.github.io/.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Concept-Based Dictionary Learning for Inference-Time Safety in Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01834v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models close the perception action loop by translating multimodal instructions into executable behaviors, but this very capability magnifies safety risks: jailbreaks that merely yield toxic text in LLMs can trigger unsafe physical actions in embodied systems. Existing defenses alignment, filtering, or prompt hardening intervene too late or at the wrong modality, leaving fused representations exploitable. We introduce a concept-based dictionary learning framework for inference-time safety control. By constructing sparse, interpretable dictionaries from hidden activations, our method identifies harmful concept directions and applies threshold-based interventions to suppress or block unsafe activations. Experiments on Libero-Harm, BadRobot, RoboPair, and IS-Bench show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, cutting attack success rates by over 70\% while maintaining task success. Crucially, the framework is plug-in and model-agnostic, requiring no retraining and integrating seamlessly with diverse VLAs. To our knowledge, this is the first inference-time concept-based safety method for embodied systems, advancing both interpretability and safe deployment of VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong generalization, with some approaches seeking to explicitly generate linguistic reasoning traces or predict future observations prior to execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching during deployment. Across 10 real-world tasks spanning tabletop, mobile, and dexterous hand manipulation, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 13%, 14% and 14% over prior SOTA VLA methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Knowing to Doing Precisely: A General Self-Correction and Termination Framework for VLA models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01811v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action (VLA) models for embodied agents integrate perception, reasoning, and control, they remain constrained by two critical weaknesses: first, during grasping tasks, the action tokens generated by the language model often exhibit subtle spatial deviations from the target object, resulting in grasp failures; second, they lack the ability to reliably recognize task completion, which leads to redundant actions and frequent timeout errors. To address these challenges and enhance robustness, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework, VLA-SCT. This framework operates as a self-correcting control loop, combining data-driven action refinement with conditional logic for termination. Consequently, compared to baseline approaches, our method achieves consistent improvements across all datasets in the LIBERO benchmark, significantly increasing the success rate of fine manipulation tasks and ensuring accurate task completion, thereby promoting the deployment of more reliable VLA agents in complex, unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Dichotomous Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00898v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Reasoning VLA: Latent Thinking and Prediction for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01166v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models benefit from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but existing approaches incur high inference overhead and rely on discrete reasoning representations that mismatch continuous perception and control. We propose Latent Reasoning VLA (\textbf{LaRA-VLA}), a unified VLA framework that internalizes multi-modal CoT reasoning into continuous latent representations for embodied action. LaRA-VLA performs unified reasoning and prediction in latent space, eliminating explicit CoT generation at inference time and enabling efficient, action-oriented control. To realize latent embodied reasoning, we introduce a curriculum-based training paradigm that progressively transitions from explicit textual and visual CoT supervision to latent reasoning, and finally adapts latent reasoning dynamics to condition action generation. We construct two structured CoT datasets and evaluate LaRA-VLA on both simulation benchmarks and long-horizon real-robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that LaRA-VLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLA methods while reducing inference latency by up to 90\% compared to explicit CoT-based approaches, demonstrating latent reasoning as an effective and efficient paradigm for real-time embodied control.

| **[Improving Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Models by Restoring Corrupted Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01158v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generalist robotic manipulation, unifying perception and control within a single end-to-end architecture. However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $π_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\% success rates to as low as 2\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamVLA: Breaking the Reason-Act Cycle via Completion-State Gating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01100v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation requires bridging the gap between high-level planning (System 2) and low-level control (System 1). Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a "Lock-and-Gated" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Data Modalities and Strategies for Co-training Large Behavior Models for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01067v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green-VLA: Staged Vision-Language-Action Model for Generalist Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00919v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Green-VLA, a staged Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for real-world deployment on the Green humanoid robot while maintaining generalization across diverse embodiments. Green-VLA follows a five stage curriculum: (L0) foundational VLMs, (L1) multimodal grounding, (R0) multi-embodiment pretraining, (R1) embodiment-specific adaptation, and (R2) reinforcement-learning (RL) policy alignment. We couple a scalable data-processing pipeline (3,000 hours of demonstrations) with temporal alignment and quality filtering, and use a unified, embodiment-aware action interface enabling a single policy to control humanoids, mobile manipulators, and fixed-base arms. At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection. Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Any3D-VLA: Enhancing VLA Robustness via Diverse Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00807v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically take 2D images as visual input, which limits their spatial understanding in complex scenes. How can we incorporate 3D information to enhance VLA capabilities? We conduct a pilot study across different observation spaces and visual representations. The results show that explicitly lifting visual input into point clouds yields representations that better complement their corresponding 2D representations. To address the challenges of (1) scarce 3D data and (2) the domain gap induced by cross-environment differences and depth-scale biases, we propose Any3D-VLA. It unifies the simulator, sensor, and model-estimated point clouds within a training pipeline, constructs diverse inputs, and learns domain-agnostic 3D representations that are fused with the corresponding 2D representations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate Any3D-VLA's advantages in improving performance and mitigating the domain gap.

| **[Environment-Aware Adaptive Pruning with Interleaved Inference Orchestration for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00780v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise in embodied intelligence, their large parameter counts lead to substantial inference latency that hinders real-time manipulation, motivating parameter sparsification. However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning. We further validate the effectiveness of EcoVLA on real-world robots.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SA-VLA: Spatially-Aware Flow-Matching for Vision-Language-Action Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00743v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit strong generalization in robotic manipulation, yet reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning often degrades robustness under spatial distribution shifts. For flow-matching VLA policies, this degradation is closely associated with the erosion of spatial inductive bias during RL adaptation, as sparse rewards and spatially agnostic exploration increasingly favor short-horizon visual cues. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{SA-VLA}, a spatially-aware RL adaptation framework that preserves spatial grounding during policy optimization by aligning representation learning, reward design, and exploration with task geometry. SA-VLA fuses implicit spatial representations with visual tokens, provides dense rewards that reflect geometric progress, and employs \textbf{SCAN}, a spatially-conditioned annealed exploration strategy tailored to flow-matching dynamics. Across challenging multi-object and cluttered manipulation benchmarks, SA-VLA enables stable RL fine-tuning and improves zero-shot spatial generalization, yielding more robust and transferable behaviors. Code and project page are available at https://xupan.top/Projects/savla.</p></details> | Version 1 |
| **[Learning to Accelerate Vision-Language-Action Models through Adaptive Visual Token Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00686v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks, yet their substantial computational overhead remains a critical obstacle to real-world deployment. Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work highlights the potential of learning task-aware computational allocation policies, paving the way for VLA models that are both powerful and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197v5)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConLA: Contrastive Latent Action Learning from Human Videos for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00557v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve preliminary generalization through pretraining on large scale robot teleoperation datasets. However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

By integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action planning, they enable general-purpose task execution across diverse environments. Despite their importance, the security of VLA models remains underexplored -- particularly in the context of backdoor attacks, which pose realistic threats in physical-world deployments. While recent methods attempt to inject backdoors into VLA models, these backdoors are easily erased during downstream adaptation, as user-side fine-tuning with clean data significantly alters model parameters, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose INFUSE (INjection into Fine-tUne-inSensitive modulEs), the first backdoor attack framework for VLA base models that remains effective even with arbitrary user fine-tuning. INFUSE begins by analyzing parameter sensitivity across diverse fine-tuning scenarios to identify modules that remain largely unchanged -- the fine-tune-insensitive modules. It then injects backdoors into these stable modules while freezing the rest, ensuring malicious behavior persists after extensive user fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VLA architectures demonstrate INFUSE's effectiveness. After user-side fine-tuning, INFUSE maintains mean attack success rates of 91.0% on simulation environments and 79.8% on real-world robot tasks, substantially surpassing BadVLA (38.8% and 36.6%, respectively), while preserving clean-task performance comparable to standard models. These results uncover a critical threat: backdoors implanted before distribution can persist through fine-tuning and remain effective at deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[TaF-VLA: Tactile-Force Alignment in Vision-Language-Action Models for Force-aware Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20321v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.</p></details> | 17pages,9fig |
| **[MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5 suites and Mikasa-Robo, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, 96.5%, and 41.2% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge and +11.8 gain on Mikasa-Robo. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

However, standard robotic fine-tuning inevitably disrupts the pre-trained feature space, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" that compromises the general visual understanding we aim to leverage. To effectively utilize the uncorrupted general capabilities of VLMs for robotic tasks, we propose TwinBrainVLA, which coordinates two isomorphic VLM pathways: a frozen generalist (also called "Left Brain") and a trainable specialist (also called "Right Brain"). Our architecture utilizes a Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism, enabling the Right Brain to dynamically query and fuse intact semantic knowledge from the Left Brain with proprioceptive states. This fused representation conditions a flow-matching action expert for precise continuous control. Empirical results on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that by explicitly retaining general capabilities, TwinBrainVLA achieves substantial performance gains over baseline models in complex manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/ZGC-EmbodyAI/TwinBrainVLA</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Models Unlock Task-Centric Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22714v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, humanoid robotics, and augmented reality. We analyzed challenges and propose solutions including agentic adaptation and cross-embodiment planning. Furthermore, we outline a forward-looking roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to strengthen socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work, is expected to serve as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence.

We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.infinitescript.com/project/dynamic-vla/ GitHub: https://github.com/hzxie/DynamicVLA</p></details> |

We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.</p></details> |  |

Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying RL to large-scale flow-based VLAs (\eg, $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods raised from flow matching. We address this challenge with $π_{\texttt{RL}}$, featuring two technical approaches: (1) \textbf{Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) \textbf{Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration. We evaluate $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ across various benchmarks, with experiments demonstrating that RL yields significant performance improvements in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts. It is pre-trained with model-based collision labels and posttrained on real robot rollouts for calibration. On five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm, CoFreeVLA reduces selfcollisions and improves success rates versus RDT and APEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIR-VLA: Vision-Language-Action Systems for Aerial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21602v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

| **[Bring My Cup! Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20014v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup," where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with videos and code: https://vap-project.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[IROS: A Dual-Process Architecture for Real-Time VLM-Based Indoor Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21506v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</p></details> | Accepted by IV |

Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to enhance an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the specified tasks. This perspective aligns with Newell's constraints-led theory of skill acquisition, which posits that motor behavior arises from interactions among task, environmental, and organismic (embodiment) constraints. Accordingly, this survey structures post-training methods into four categories: (i) enhancing environmental perception, (ii) improving embodiment awareness, (iii) deepening task comprehension, and (iv) multi-component integration. Experimental results on standard benchmarks are synthesized to distill actionable guidelines. Finally, open challenges and emerging trends are outlined, relating insights from human learning to prospective methods for VLA post-training. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

| **[Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20334v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Expanded systematic review; resubmitted to Robotics</p></details> |

We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Evaluation of Robotic Manipulation: A New Benchmark and AutoEval Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18723v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid evolution of Vision-Action and Vision-Language-Action models, imitation learning has significantly advanced robotic manipulation capabilities. However, evaluation methodologies have lagged behind, hindering the establishment of Trustworthy Evaluation for these behaviors. Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively. Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation.

To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-vla/, Code: https://github.com/Robbyant/lingbot-vla/</p></details> |

This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |
| **[TC-IDM: Grounding Video Generation for Executable Zero-shot Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18323v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control. TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals. This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects. In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding. In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors. On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.

To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. We leverage the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduce system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy. This work makes motion-centric analysis practical for edge deployment and offers a complementary perspective to existing egocentric studies on sports and fast-movement activities.</p></details> |  |

These methods rely on differentiable action likelihoods, which constrain policy outputs to simple distributions like Gaussians. In this work, we show how flow matching policy gradients -- a recent framework that bypasses likelihood computation -- can be made effective for training and fine-tuning more expressive policies in challenging robot control settings. We introduce an improved objective that enables success in legged locomotion, humanoid motion tracking, and manipulation tasks, as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on two humanoid robots. We then present ablations and analysis on training dynamics. Results show how policies can exploit the flow representation for exploration when training from scratch, as well as improved fine-tuning robustness over baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://hongsukchoi.github.io/fpo-control</p></details> |

Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models.

Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ttt-parkour.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Before Autonomy Takes Control: Software Testing in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02293v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are complex and safety-critical software systems. As such, they need to be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, robot software is intrinsically hard to test compared to traditional software, mainly since the software needs to closely interact with hardware, account for uncertainty in its operational environment, handle disturbances, and act highly autonomously. However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned.</p></details> |  |
| **[MineInsight: A Multi-sensor Dataset for Humanitarian Demining Robotics in Off-Road Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04842v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset provides bounding boxes generated by an automated pipeline and refined with human supervision. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/mariomlz99/MineInsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13255v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $π_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $π_0$ by 8.9% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://koorye.github.io/PCD.</p></details> |  |

However, existing robotic spines typically lack the active compliance required to support such dynamic behaviours. We present SPARC, a compact 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that enables simultaneous revolute and prismatic motions within a 1.26 kg package. Using a floating-base impedance controller, we facilitate independent, task-space tuning of spinal stiffness and damping to mimic biological load-bearing strategies. Benchtop experiments confirm high-fidelity rendering of commanded impedance, with linear force-displacement error within 1.5%. Systematic locomotion simulations reveal a critical speed-dependency: while low-speed efficiency is insensitive to spinal properties, precise impedance tuning becomes indispensable for high-speed performance. Our results demonstrate that an optimally compliant spine reduces power consumption by 21% at 0.9 m/s compared to a rigid-spine baseline. This efficiency gain is mechanistically attributed to the spine's role in augmenting stride length and acting as a mechanical low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency torque fluctuations. SPARC provides an open-source platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion. Available at: github.com/YueWang996/sparc</p></details> |  |

Traditional mapping approaches provide accurate geometric representations but are often constrained by pre-designed symbolic vocabularies. The reliance on fixed object classes makes it impractical to handle out-of-distribution knowledge not defined at design time. Recent advances in Vision-Language Foundation Models, such as CLIP, enable open-set mapping, where objects are encoded as high-dimensional embeddings rather than fixed labels. In LIEREx, we integrate these VLFMs with established 3D Semantic Scene Graphs to enable target-directed exploration by an autonomous agent in partially unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, when the number of labels for each task is not equal, namely imbalanced data exist, a problem may arise due to insufficient number of samples, and labeling is not very easy for mobile robots in every environment. We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks. We investigate this by training the teacher network with the task outputs such as depth as inputs. We further provide empirical evidence when trained with a small amount of data. We use semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks on different datasets, NYUDv2 and Cityscapes.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Especially in applications such as shared control the user and the robot must share the same model of the objects in the world, and the actions that can be performed on these objects. In this paper, we achieve this with a so-called model reconciliation framework. We leverage a Large Language Model to predict and explain the difference between the robot's and the human's mental models, without the need of a formal mental model of the user. Furthermore, our framework aims to solve the model divergence after the explanation by allowing the human to correct the robot. We provide an implementation in an assistive robotics domain, where we conduct a set of experiments with a real wheelchair-based mobile manipulator and its digital twin.</p></details> |  |

However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching during deployment. Across 10 real-world tasks spanning tabletop, mobile, and dexterous hand manipulation, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 13%, 14% and 14% over prior SOTA VLA methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in the whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted for publication as a SPECIAL ISSUE paper in the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |

First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example, along with simulation and experimental comparisons, is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.</p></details> |  |

First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

| **[A Closed-Form Geometric Retargeting Solver for Upper Body Humanoid Robot Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01632v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://sew-mimic.com/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Safe and Stable Neural Network Dynamical Systems S$^2$-NNDS, a learning-from-demonstration framework that simultaneously learns expressive neural dynamical systems alongside neural Lyapunov stability and barrier safety certificates. Unlike traditional approaches with restrictive polynomial parameterizations, S$^2$-NNDS leverages neural networks to capture complex robot motions, providing probabilistic guarantees through split conformal prediction in learned certificates. Experimental results in various 2D and 3D datasets -- including LASA handwriting and demonstrations recorded kinesthetically from the Franka Emika Panda robot -- validate the effectiveness of S$^2$-NNDS in learning robust, safe, and stable motions from potentially unsafe demonstrations.

| **[RAPT: Model-Predictive Out-of-Distribution Detection and Failure Diagnosis for Sim-to-Real Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01515v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying learned control policies on humanoid robots is challenging: policies that appear robust in simulation can execute confidently in out-of-distribution (OOD) states after Sim-to-Real transfer, leading to silent failures that risk hardware damage. Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Novel Wearable Robotic Vest for Hemorrhage Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01448v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel robotic system designed to manage severe bleeding in emergency scenarios, including unique environments like space stations. The robot features a shape-adjustable "ring mechanism", transitioning from a circular to an elliptical configuration to adjust wound coverage across various anatomical regions. We developed various arms for this ring mechanism with varying flexibilities to improve adaptability when applied to non-extremities of the body (abdomen, back, neck, etc.). To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified. The shape-changing effect of the device is limited to scenarios involving partially inflated or deflated airbag balloons, and cannot fully conform to complex anatomical regions. Finally, the device was tested on casualty simulation kits, where it successfully demonstrated its ability to control simulated bleeding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Robotic Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01389v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation networks, which are essential for robotic perception, often suffer from performance degradation when the visual distribution of the deployment environment differs from that of the source dataset on which they were trained. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[TriphiBot: A Triphibious Robot Combining FOC-based Propulsion with Eccentric Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01385v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Triphibious robots capable of multi-domain motion and cross-domain transitions are promising to handle complex tasks across diverse environments. However, existing designs primarily focus on dual-mode platforms, and some designs suffer from high mechanical complexity or low propulsion efficiency, which limits their application. In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system.</p></details> |  |

To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to enable the study of embodied social intelligence at scale. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

To assist surgeons achieve this level of accuracy, the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I2RIS) with dexterous capability has been developed. However, such flexible tendon-driven robots often suffer from hysteresis problems, which significantly challenges precise control and positioning. In particular, we observed multi-stage hysteresis phenomena in the small-scale I2RIS. In this paper, we propose an Extended Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (EGPI) model to increase the fitting accuracy of the hysteresis. The model incorporates a novel switching mechanism that enables it to describe multi-stage hysteresis in the regions of monotonic input. Experimental validation on I2RIS data demonstrates that the EGPI model outperforms the conventional Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (GPI) model in terms of RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE across multiple motor input directions. The EGPI model in our study highlights the potential in modeling multi-stage hysteresis in minimally invasive flexible robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IFAC-PapersOnLine, Vol. 59, No. 30, pp. 323-328, 2025. 5th Conference on Modeling, Estimation and Control (MECC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[UniForce: A Unified Latent Force Model for Robot Manipulation with Diverse Tactile Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01153v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Force sensing is essential for dexterous robot manipulation, but scaling force-aware policy learning is hindered by the heterogeneity of tactile sensors. Differences in sensing principles (e.g., optical vs. magnetic), form factors, and materials typically require sensor-specific data collection, calibration, and model training, thereby limiting generalisability. We propose UniForce, a novel unified tactile representation learning framework that learns a shared latent force space across diverse tactile sensors. UniForce reduces cross-sensor domain shift by jointly modeling inverse dynamics (image-to-force) and forward dynamics (force-to-image), constrained by force equilibrium and image reconstruction losses to produce force-grounded representations. To avoid reliance on expensive external force/torque (F/T) sensors, we exploit static equilibrium and collect force-paired data via direct sensor--object--sensor interactions, enabling cross-sensor alignment with contact force. The resulting universal tactile encoder can be plugged into downstream force-aware robot manipulation tasks with zero-shot transfer, without retraining or finetuning. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tactile sensors including GelSight, TacTip, and uSkin, demonstrate consistent improvements in force estimation over prior methods, and enable effective cross-sensor coordination in Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA) models for a robotic wiping task. Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Edge to Edge: A Flow-Inspired Scheduling Planner for Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06952v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is crucial in multi-robot systems, particularly in environments with numerous obstacles. While extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of coordinating multiple robots to flow collectively from one side of the map to the other-such as in crossing missions through obstacle-rich spaces-has received limited attention. This paper focuses on this directional traversal scenario by introducing a real-time scheduling scheme that enables multi-robot systems to move from edge to edge, emulating the smooth and efficient flow of water. Inspired by network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a flow-based network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion levels. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, aiming to minimize overall traversal time by balancing detours and waiting times. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving fast and coordinated traversal. Furthermore, real-world flight tests with ten drones validate its practical feasibility. This work contributes a flow-inspired, real-time scheduling planner tailored for directional multi-robot traversal in complex, obstacle-rich environments.

| **[Information Filtering via Variational Regularization for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21926v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN We Flow? Advancing Robotic Manipulation with 3D Flow Matching via KAN & RWKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01115v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

| **[A Systematic Study of Data Modalities and Strategies for Co-training Large Behavior Models for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01067v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.</p></details> |  |

However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection.

To address this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition, utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches. Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34 garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth manipulation.

In this paper we introduce JANUS, a cognitive architecture for assistive robots that models interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process and realizes control as a factored controller with typed interfaces. To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies. Models inspired by the notion of inner speech in cognitive theories provide a control-oriented internal textual flow that validates parameter completeness and triggers clarification before grounding, while a faithfulness constraint ties robot-to-human claims to an evidence bundle combining working context and retrieved tool outputs. We evaluate JANUS through module-level unit tests in a dietary assistance domain grounded on a knowledge graph, reporting high agreement with curated references and practical latency profiles. These results support factored reasoning as a promising path to scalable, auditable, and evidence-grounded robot assistance over extended interaction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConLA: Contrastive Latent Action Learning from Human Videos for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00557v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve preliminary generalization through pretraining on large scale robot teleoperation datasets. However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

However, their movements within the intimate near-body space raise unresolved challenges for perceived safety, user control, and trust. In this paper, we present results from a Wizard-of-Oz study (n=18), where participants completed near-body collaboration tasks with SRLs to explore these challenges. We collected qualitative data through think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews, complemented by physiological signals and post-task ratings. Findings indicate that greater autonomy did not inherently enhance perceived safety or trust. Instead, participants identified near-body zones and paired them with clear coordination rules. They also expressed expectations for how different arm components should behave, shaping preferences around autonomy, perceived safety, and trust. Building on these insights, we introduce SRL Proxemics, a zone- and segment-level design framework showing that autonomy is not monolithic: perceived safety hinges on spatially calibrated, legible behaviors, not higher autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI 2026.

We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[RVDebloater: Mode-based Adaptive Firmware Debloating for Robotic Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00270v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of embedded devices grows and their functional requirements increase, embedded firmware is becoming increasingly larger, thereby expanding its attack surface. Despite the increase in firmware size, many embedded devices, such as robotic vehicles (RVs), operate in distinct modes, each requiring only a small subset of the firmware code at runtime. We refer to such devices as mode-based embedded devices. Debloating is an approach to reduce attack surfaces by removing or restricting unneeded code, but existing techniques suffer from significant limitations, such as coarse granularity and irreversible code removal, limiting their applicability. To address these limitations, we propose RVDebloater, a novel adaptive debloating technique for mode-based embedded devices that automatically identifies unneeded firmware code for each mode using either static or dynamic analysis, and dynamically debloats the firmware for each mode at the function level at runtime. RVDebloater introduces a new software-based enforcement approach that supports diverse mode-based embedded devices. We implemented RVDebloater using the LLVM compiler and evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness on six different RVs, including both simulated and real ones, with different real-world missions. We find that device requirements change throughout its lifetime for each mode, and that many critical firmware functions can be restricted in other modes, with an average of 85% of functions not being required. The results showed that none of the missions failed after debloating with RVDebloater, indicating that it neither incurred false positives nor false negatives. Further, RVDebloater prunes the firmware call graph by an average of 45% across different firmware. Finally, RVDebloater incurred an average performance overhead of 3.9% and memory overhead of 4% (approximately 0.25 MB) on real RVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space. We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution. LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Framework of Key Performance Indicators for Multi-Robot Lunar and Planetary Field Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20529v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Geometrically-Grounded 3D Visual Representations for View-Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22988v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic manipulation demands visuomotor policies capable of robust spatial scene understanding and strong generalization across diverse camera viewpoints. While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[About an Automating Annotation Method for Robot Markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22982v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5 suites and Mikasa-Robo, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, 96.5%, and 41.2% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge and +11.8 gain on Mikasa-Robo. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model the actual motion captured in real-world observations, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

Whilst there is broad consensus that robots can assist in mitigating physical impairments, the extent to which they can facilitate social inclusion remains equivocal. In fact, the exposed status of assisted workers could likewise lead to reduced or increased perceived stigma by other workers. We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot. In addition, offering robot-assisted work for everyone, in the sense of universal design, further reduces perceived cognitive stigma. Thus, we conclude that assistive robots reduce perceived cognitive stigma, thereby supporting the use of collaborative robots in work scenarios involving PwDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Companion Proceedings of the 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction</p></details> |

However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The International Journal of Robotics Research</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

While traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generate metric reconstructions and can be extended to metric-semantic mapping, they lack a higher level of abstraction and relational reasoning. To address this gap, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful representation for capturing hierarchical structures and object relationships. In this work, we propose an enhanced hierarchical 3D scene graph that integrates open-vocabulary features across multiple abstraction levels and supports object-relational reasoning. Our approach leverages a Vision Language Model (VLM) to infer semantic relationships. Notably, we introduce a task reasoning module that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and a VLM to interpret the scene graph's semantic and relational information, enabling agents to reason about tasks and interact with their environment more intelligently. We validate our method by deploying it on a quadruped robot in multiple environments and tasks, highlighting its ability to reason about them.</p></details> | ICRA 2026, 8 pages |

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |

While some recent works have edited vision-language models (VLMs), no existing editors tackle reasoning-heavy tasks, which typically require humans and models to reason about images.We therefore propose ReasonEdit, the first VLM editor to let users explain their reasoning during editing, introducing a new, practical model editing setup. ReasonEdit continuously stores human reasoning in a codebook, and retrieves only relevant facts during inference using a novel topology-balanced multimodal embedding method inspired by network science. Across four VLMs on multiple rationale-based visual question answering datasets, ReasonEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance, ultimately showing that using human reasoning during editing greatly improves edit generalization.</p></details> |  |

In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, most eHMI studies rely on developer-crafted message-action pairs, which are difficult to adapt to diverse and dynamic traffic contexts. A promising alternative is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as action designers that generate context-conditioned eHMI actions, yet such designers lack perceptual verification and typically depend on fixed prompts or costly human-annotated feedback for improvement. We present See2Refine, a human-free, closed-loop framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) perceptual evaluation as automated visual feedback to improve an LLM-based eHMI action designer. Given a driving context and a candidate eHMI action, the VLM evaluates the perceived appropriateness of the action, and this feedback is used to iteratively revise the designer's outputs, enabling systematic refinement without human supervision. We evaluate our framework across three eHMI modalities (lightbar, eyes, and arm) and multiple LLM model sizes. Across settings, our framework consistently outperforms prompt-only LLM designers and manually specified baselines in both VLM-based metrics and human-subject evaluations. Results further indicate that the improvements generalize across modalities and that VLM evaluations are well aligned with human preferences, supporting the robustness and effectiveness of See2Refine for scalable action design.</p></details> | Under Review |

Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the SciTextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,270 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the deep connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Built through an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects, implements, and standardizes scientific and generative models. This AI pipeline is also used to autonomously invent and implement novel methods for generating visual patterns and textures. SciTextures enables systematic evaluation of vision language models (VLM's) ability to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerge from the same underlying process. We also test VLMs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world phenomenon and asking the AI to identify and code a model of the process that formed it, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the reference image. These benchmarks reveal that VLM's can understand and simulate physical systems beyond visual patterns at multiple levels of abstraction.

Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., "a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., "In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel "Confusion Benchmark" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter. We release the Auto-Comp pipeline to facilitate future benchmark creation, alongside all our generated benchmarks (https://huggingface.co/AutoComp).</p></details> |  |
| **[VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10942v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Genomic Modeling Through Optical Character Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02014v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent genomic foundation models largely adopt large language model architectures that treat DNA as a one-dimensional token sequence. However, exhaustive sequential reading is structurally misaligned with sparse and discontinuous genomic semantics, leading to wasted computation on low-information background and preventing understanding-driven compression for long contexts. Here, we present OpticalDNA, a vision-based framework that reframes genomic modeling as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-style document understanding. OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \emph{trainable} parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Image Understanding through Delimiter Token Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01984v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While prior work has integrated LLMs and VLMs into various components of RL, the replay buffer, a core component for storing and reusing experiences, remains unexplored. We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer. Our key idea is to use a frozen, pre-trained VLM (requiring no fine-tuning) as an automated evaluator to identify and prioritize promising sub-trajectories from the agent's experiences. Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model, RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks. The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible. These results highlight the potential of street-view-guided data acquisition for efficient and cost-effective cross-country model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeOCR: On the Effectiveness of Vision Language Models in Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01785v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/CodeOCR</p></details> |

For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplicity Prevails: The Emergence of Generalizable AIGI Detection in Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01738v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While specialized detectors for AI-Generated Images (AIGI) achieve near-perfect accuracy on curated benchmarks, they suffer from a dramatic performance collapse in realistic, in-the-wild scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at AAAI 2026.

Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCALL: Recalibrating Capability Degradation for MLLM-based Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01639v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images based on a hybrid query comprising a reference image and a modification text. Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[PISCES: Annotation-free Text-to-Video Post-Training via Optimal Transport-Aligned Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01624v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation aims to synthesize videos with high visual quality and temporal consistency that are semantically aligned with input text. Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Generative Visual Code Mobile World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01576v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print (technical report)</p></details> |

Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically Guided Dynamic Visual Prototype Refinement for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07114v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) seeks to recognize unseen state-object pairs by recombining primitives learned from seen compositions. Despite recent progress with vision-language models (VLMs), two limitations remain: (i) text-driven semantic prototypes are weakly discriminative in the visual feature space; and (ii) unseen pairs are optimized passively, thereby inducing seen bias. To address these limitations, we present Duplex, a framework that couples dual-prototype learning with dynamic local-graph refinement of visual prototypes. For each composition, Duplex maintains a semantic prototype via prompt learning and a visual prototype for unseen pairs constructed by recombining disentangled state and object primitives from seen images. The visual prototypes are updated dynamically through lightweight aggregation on mini-batch local graphs, which incorporates unseen compositions during training without labels. This design introduces fine-grained visual evidence while preserving semantic structure. It enriches class prototypes, better disambiguates semantically similar yet visually distinct pairs, and mitigates seen bias. Experiments on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and CGQA in closed-world and open-world settings achieve competitive performance and consistent compositional generalization.

| **[Preserving Localized Patch Semantics in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01530v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logit Lens has been proposed for visualizing tokens that contribute most to LLM answers. Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word "cat"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.</p></details> |  |

Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a "machine Bertin" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE TVCG on February 2026</p></details> |

Compared to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors, ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.</p></details> | 97 pages |

This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a "part-versus-whole" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGMOD'26; two column layout version</p></details> |

While crowdsourced platforms and vision-language-models (VLMs) expand AD production, quality is rarely checked systematically. Existing evaluations rely on NLP metrics and short-clip guidelines, leaving questions about what constitutes quality for full-length content and how to assess it at scale. To address these questions, we first developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework for uninterrupted, full-length video, grounded in professional guidelines and refined by accessibility specialists. Second, we integrated this framework into a comprehensive methodological workflow, utilizing Item Response Theory, to assess the proficiency of VLM and human raters against expert-established ground truth. Findings suggest that while VLMs can approximate ground-truth ratings with high alignment, their reasoning was found to be less reliable and actionable than that of human respondents. These insights show the potential of hybrid evaluation systems that leverage VLMs alongside human oversight, offering a path towards scalable AD quality control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Specific Task Similarity for Vision Language Model Selection via Layer Conductance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01346v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open sourced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have proliferated, selecting the optimal pretrained model for a specific downstream task remains challenging. Exhaustive evaluation is often infeasible due to computational constraints and data limitations in few shot scenarios. Existing selection methods fail to fully address this: they either rely on data-intensive proxies or use symmetric textual descriptors that neglect the inherently directional and model-specific nature of transferability. To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference. Experimental results on 48 VLMs across 21 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 14.7% improvement in NDCG@5 over SWAB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Disentangling Tool-Induced and Intrinsic Effects for Crop-and-Zoom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01334v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision tool-use reinforcement learning (RL) can equip vision-language models with visual operators such as crop-and-zoom and achieves strong performance gains, yet it remains unclear whether these gains are driven by improvements in tool use or evolving intrinsic capabilities.We introduce MED (Measure-Explain-Diagnose), a coarse-to-fine framework that disentangles intrinsic capability changes from tool-induced effects, decomposes the tool-induced performance difference into gain and harm terms, and probes the mechanisms driving their evolution. Across checkpoint-level analyses on two VLMs with different tool priors and six benchmarks, we find that improvements are dominated by intrinsic learning, while tool-use RL mainly reduces tool-induced harm (e.g., fewer call-induced errors and weaker tool schema interference) and yields limited progress in tool-based correction of intrinsic failures. Overall, current vision tool-use RL learns to coexist safely with tools rather than master them.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/Med</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Med3D-R1, a reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). During SFT stage, we introduce a residual alignment mechanism to bridge the gap between high-dimensional 3D features and textual embeddings, and an abnormality re-weighting strategy to emphasize clinically informative tokens and reduce structural bias in reports. In RL stage, we redesign the consistency reward to explicitly promote coherent, step-by-step diagnostic reasoning. We evaluate our method on medical multiple-choice visual question answering using two 3D diagnostic benchmarks, CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT, where our model attains state-of-the-art accuracies of 41.92\% on CT-RATE and 44.99\% on RAD-ChestCT. These results indicate improved abnormality diagnosis and clinical reasoning and outperform prior methods on both benchmarks. Overall, our approach holds promise for enhancing real-world diagnostic workflows by enabling more reliable and transparent 3D medical vision-language systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01167v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations. Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  |

While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures.

| **[A Systematic Study of Data Modalities and Strategies for Co-training Large Behavior Models for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01067v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.</p></details> |  |

Vision foundation models (\textit{e.g.}, DINO) excel at mining local textures, and vision-language models (\textit{e.g.}, CLIP) capture strong global semantic difference. Existing methods predominantly rely on a single paradigm, neglecting the potential benefits of their integration. In this paper, we analyze the complementary roles of these two architectures and propose a framework to synergize their strengths by a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{R}egularized Bidirectional \textbf{Transformer} (\textbf{DRFormer}). The dual-regularization mechanism ensures diverse feature extraction and achieves a better balance in the contributions of the two models. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our method effectively harmonizes local and global representations, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[VEQ: Modality-Adaptive Quantization for MoE Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01037v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer remarkable performance but incur prohibitive memory and computational costs, making compression essential. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/guangshuoqin/VEQ.</p></details> |  |

However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/kaiyuanCui/UltraBreak}{GitHub repository}.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning. HERMES further introduces a Tri-Modal Driving Module that fuses multi-view perception, historical motion cues, and semantic guidance, ensuring risk-aware accurate trajectory planning under long-tail scenarios. Experiments on the real-world long-tail dataset demonstrate that HERMES consistently outperforms representative end-to-end and VLM-driven baselines under long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios. Ablation studies verify the complementary contributions of key components.</p></details> |  |

The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. Experiments on HICO-DET across multiple open-source MLLMs, including the Qwen-VL family (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL) and Rex-Omni, show consistent improvements. Especially, HOI-R1 boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B 2$\times$ accuracy with great generalization ability. The source code is available at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.</p></details> |  |

Existing token reduction methods typically exploit \textit{either} vision-encoder saliency (broad but query-agnostic) \textit{or} LLM cross-attention (query-aware but sparse and costly). We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking). However, making such fusion practical is non-trivial: cross-modal saliency is usually only available \emph{inside} the LLM (too late for efficient pre-LLM pruning), and the two signals are inherently asymmetric, so naive fusion underutilizes their complementary strengths. We propose \textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> | Technical Report |

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |

While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities. Extensive experiments, including objective metrics and user studies, demonstrate that Infinite-World achieves superior performance in visual quality, action controllability, and spatial consistency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning from Structural Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02381v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-embedding self-supervised learning (SSL), the key paradigm for unsupervised representation learning from visual data, learns from invariances between semantically-related data pairs. We study the one-to-many mapping problem in SSL, where each datum may be mapped to multiple valid targets. This arises when data pairs come from naturally occurring generative processes, e.g., successive video frames. We show that existing methods struggle to flexibly capture this conditional uncertainty. As a remedy, we introduce a latent variable to account for this uncertainty and derive a variational lower bound on the mutual information between paired embeddings. Our derivation yields a simple regularization term for standard SSL objectives. The resulting method, which we call AdaSSL, applies to both contrastive and distillation-based SSL objectives, and we empirically show its versatility in causal representation learning, fine-grained image understanding, and world modeling on videos.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

We propose \emph{choice-model-assisted RL}: a calibrated discrete choice model is used as a fixed partial world model to impute the delayed component of the learning target at decision time. In the fixed-model deployment regime, we prove that tabular Q-learning with model-imputed targets converges to an $O(\varepsilon/(1-γ))$ neighborhood of the optimal Q-function, where $\varepsilon$ summarizes partial-model error, with an additional $O(t^{-1/2})$ sampling term. Experiments in a simulator calibrated from 61{,}619 hotel bookings (1{,}088 independent runs) show: (i) no statistically detectable difference from a maturity-buffer DQN baseline in stationary settings; (ii) positive effects under in-family parameter shifts, with significant gains in 5 of 10 shift scenarios after Holm--Bonferroni correction (up to 12.4\%); and (iii) consistent degradation under structural misspecification, where the choice model assumptions are violated (1.4--2.6\% lower revenue). These results characterize when partial behavioral models improve robustness under shift and when they introduce harmful bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of World Model Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02110v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniDriveDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both video and LiDAR generation, while also yielding measurable improvements in downstream</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we propose Grounding Video Plans with World Models (GVP-WM), a planning method that grounds video-generated plans into feasible action sequences using a learned action-conditioned world model. At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan. Empirically, GVP-WM recovers feasible long-horizon plans from zero-shot image-to-video-generated and motion-blurred videos that violate physical constraints, across navigation and manipulation simulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing efforts simply model the 2D visual dynamics, which is insufficient for robust manipulation when target tasks involve prominent depth-wise movement. To address this, we present a 3D dynamics-aware manipulation framework that seamlessly integrates 3D world modeling and policy learning. Three self-supervised learning tasks (current depth estimation, future RGB-D prediction, 3D flow prediction) are introduced within our framework, which complement each other and endow the policy model with 3D foresight. Extensive experiments on simulation and the real world show that 3D foresight can greatly boost the performance of manipulation policies without sacrificing inference speed.

However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dvirsamuel.github.io/fast-auto-regressive-video/</p></details> |

However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models.

| **[SafePred: A Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01725v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01644v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 742 citations, 1 figure, 3 tables.

The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print (technical report)</p></details> |

We present UniDWM, a unified driving world model that advances autonomous driving through multifaceted representation learning. UniDWM constructs a structure- and dynamic-aware latent world representation that serves as a physically grounded state space, enabling consistent reasoning across perception, prediction, and planning. Specifically, a joint reconstruction pathway learns to recover the scene's structure, including geometry and visual texture, while a collaborative generation framework leverages a conditional diffusion transformer to forecast future world evolution within the latent space. Furthermore, we show that our UniDWM can be deemed as a variation of VAE, which provides theoretical guidance for the multifaceted representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniDWM in trajectory planning, 4D reconstruction and generation, highlighting the potential of multifaceted world representations as a foundation for unified driving intelligence.

However, extending such success to 3D dynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges, primarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive descriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the initiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions without direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in achieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. Being unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we instead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large language model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers high-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies of low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce a world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions influence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework, InterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot manner. We apply InterDreamer to the BEHAVE and CHAIRS datasets, and our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates its capability to generate realistic and coherent interaction sequences that seamlessly align with the text directives.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

Model-based reinforcement learning offers a promising path to improved sample efficiency through world models, but standard monolithic architectures struggle to capture diverse task dynamics, resulting in poor reconstruction and prediction accuracy. We introduce Mixture-of-World Models (MoW), a scalable architecture that combines modular variational autoencoders for task-adaptive visual compression, a hybrid Transformer-based dynamics model with task-conditioned experts and a shared backbone, and a gradient-based task clustering strategy for efficient parameter allocation. On the Atari 100k benchmark, a single MoW agent trained once on 26 Atari games achieves a mean human-normalized score of 110.4%, competitive with the score of 114.2% achieved by STORM, an ensemble of 26 task-specific models, while using 50% fewer parameters. On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art. These results demonstrate that MoW provides a scalable and parameter-efficient foundation for generalist world models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Human-Inspired Neuro-Symbolic World Modeling and Logic Reasoning for Interpretable Safe UAV Landing Site Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22204v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable assessment of safe landing sites in unstructured environments is essential for deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in real-world applications such as delivery, inspection, and surveillance. Existing learning-based approaches often degrade under covariate shift and offer limited transparency, making their decisions difficult to interpret and validate on resource-constrained platforms. We present NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic framework for marker-free UAV landing site safety assessment that explicitly separates perception-driven world modeling from logic-based safety reasoning. A lightweight segmentation model incrementally constructs a probabilistic semantic scene graph encoding objects, attributes, and spatial relations. Symbolic safety rules, synthesized offline via large language models with human-in-the-loop refinement, are executed directly over this world model at runtime to perform white-box reasoning, producing ranked landing candidates with human-readable explanations of the underlying safety constraints. Across 72 simulated and hardware-in-the-loop landing scenarios, NeuroSymLand achieves 61 successful assessments, outperforming four competitive baselines, which achieve between 37 and 57 successes. Qualitative analysis highlights its superior interpretability and transparent reasoning, while deployment incurs negligible edge overhead. Our results suggest that combining explicit world modeling with symbolic reasoning can support accurate, interpretable, and edge-deployable safety assessment in mobile systems, as demonstrated through UAV landing site assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models as an Intermediary between Agents and the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00785v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents trained using reinforcement learning has achieved superhuman performance in low-cost environments like games, mathematics, and coding. However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science. Lastly, we identify the challenges of building these world models and propose actionable items along dataset curation, architecture design, scaling, and evaluation of world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Generative Game Engine: Breaking the Resolution Wall via Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00608v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time generative game engines represent a paradigm shift in interactive simulation, promising to replace traditional graphics pipelines with neural world models. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \times 480$ resolution -- a $50\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under Review</p></details> |

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a promising solution for distributed control, yet it often requires costly real-world interactions and lacks generalization across diverse tasks. Meanwhile, recent advances in Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex dynamics and supporting high-fidelity simulation. Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, we propose a Communication-based Diffusion World Model (NetWorld) to enable few-shot generalization across heterogeneous MARL tasks in wireless networks. To improve applicability to large-scale distributed networks, NetWorld adopts the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm and is organized into a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a classifier-guided conditional diffusion world model on multi-task offline datasets, and (ii) performing trajectory planning entirely within this world model to avoid additional online interaction. Cross-task heterogeneity is handled via shared latent processing for observations, two-hot discretization for task-specific actions and rewards, and an inverse dynamics model for action recovery. We further introduce a lightweight Mean Field (MF) communication mechanism to reduce non-stationarity and promote coordinated behaviors with low overhead. Experiments on three representative tasks demonstrate improved performance and sample efficiency over MARL baselines, indicating strong scalability and practical potential for wireless network optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, using them for planning can be challenging due to the vast and unstructured search space. We propose a robust and highly parallelizable planner that leverages the differentiability of the learned world model for efficient optimization, solving long-horizon control tasks from visual input. Our method treats states as optimization variables ("virtual states") with soft dynamics constraints, enabling parallel computation and easier optimization. To facilitate exploration and avoid local optima, we introduce stochasticity into the states. To mitigate sensitive gradients through high-dimensional vision-based world models, we modify the gradient structure to descend towards valid plans while only requiring action-input gradients. Our planner, which we call GRASP (Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner), can be viewed as a stochastic version of a non-condensed or collocation-based optimal controller. We provide theoretical justification and experiments on video-based world models, where our resulting planner outperforms existing planning algorithms like the cross-entropy method (CEM) and vanilla gradient-based optimization (GD) on long-horizon experiments, both in success rate and time to convergence.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

DISK coordinates two coupled diffusion transformers for video and ego-trajectory via dual-branch controllers with cross-modal skip decisions, preserving motion-appearance consistency without retraining. We extend higher-order latent-difference skip testing to the autoregressive chain-of-forward regime and propagate controller statistics through rollout loops for long-horizon stability. When integrated into closed-loop driving rollouts on 1500 NuPlan and NuScenes samples using an NVIDIA L40S GPU, DISK achieves 2x speedup on trajectory diffusion and 1.6x speedup on video diffusion while maintaining L2 planning error, visual quality (FID/FVD), and NAVSIM PDMS scores, demonstrating practical long-horizon video-and-trajectory prediction at substantially reduced cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional value gradients for stochastic environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20071v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-regularized value learning methods improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned models of transition dynamics and rewards to estimate return gradients. However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.</p></details> |  |

A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026. 10 pages.

However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the number of inference tokens increases. This work addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. The first stage (normalisation) refines standard attention by replacing Softmax with the more numerically stable Softplus followed by $l_{1}$-normalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy. We show that this novel attention mechanism outperforms conventional Softmax attention, and state-of-the-art Softmax-free alternatives. Our second proposal is to introduce a second processing stage (sharpening) which consists of a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attentional weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens, mitigating the attention sink phenomenon, and fundamentally improving length extrapolation. This novel, two-stage, replacement for self-attention is shown to ensure numerical stability and dramatically improve length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and downstream benchmarks. Furthermore, symbolic regression experiments demonstrate that our method enables models to recover Newton's gravitational law from orbital trajectory sequences, providing evidence that appropriate attention mechanisms are crucial for foundation models to develop genuine physical world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages for ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Policy-Driven World Model Adaptation for Robust Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13709v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00559v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to structure and reason about implicit social contexts, as they lack explicit representations for unobserved dynamics such as intentions, beliefs, and evolving social states. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social world models (SWMs) to characterize the complex social dynamics. To operationalize SWMs, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), which captures the evolving states, actions, and mental states of agents, addressing the lack of explicit structure in traditional free-text-based inputs. Through comprehensive experiments across five social reasoning benchmarks, we show that S3AP significantly enhances LLM performance-achieving a +51% improvement on FANToM over OpenAI's o1. Our ablations further reveal that these gains are driven by the explicit modeling of hidden mental states, which proves more effective than a wide range of baseline methods. Finally, we introduce an algorithm for social world models using S3AP, which enables AI agents to build models of their interlocutors and predict their next actions and mental states. Empirically, S3AP-enabled social world models yield up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA multi-turn social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaWeb: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning of Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22149v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.</p></details> |  |

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22128v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.</p></details> |  |

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-va Code: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-va</p></details> |

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project's code can be found at https://github.com/flowersteam/WorldLLM.

| **[PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.</p></details> | 43 pages, ICLR 2026 |
| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://world-bench.github.io/</p></details> |

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p></details> |  |

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates.

We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thuml.github.io/Reasoning-Visual-World</p></details> |
