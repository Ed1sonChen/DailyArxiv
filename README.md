| **[PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-ACT: Learn from Multimodal Parallel Generation to Act](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00975v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning. We release our codes, models and data at https://github.com/HHYHRHY/MM-ACT.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[See Once, Then Act: Vision-Language-Action Model with Task Learning from One-Shot Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07582v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robust and general-purpose manipulation policies represents a fundamental objective in robotics research. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos. Real-world experiments demonstrate effective learning from human videos, yielding more than 38% improvement on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Field Intervention: Enabling VLAs to Escape Memory Traps in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07472v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great performance in robotic manipulation by mapping visual observations and language instructions directly to actions. However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the "Memory Trap". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FASTer: Toward Efficient Autoregressive Vision Language Action Modeling via Neural Action Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04952v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoVLA: Video Generators Can Be Generalizable Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06963v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization in robot manipulation is essential for deploying robots in open-world environments and advancing toward artificial general intelligence. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videovla-nips2025.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Task adaptation of Vision-Language-Action model: 1st Place Solution for the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06951v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making. Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NeurIPS Behavior Challenge 1st place solution</p></details> |
| **[Dejavu: Towards Experience Feedback Learning for Embodied Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10181v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire additional knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN identifies contextually prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to train EFN, ensuring that the predicted actions align with past behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience". Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. We provide code and demo in our supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAM-Flow: Parallel Coarse-to-Fine Motion Planning via Discrete Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06112v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Training-Time Action Conditioning for Efficient Real-Time Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05964v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time chunking (RTC) enables vision-language-action models (VLAs) to generate smooth, reactive robot trajectories by asynchronously predicting action chunks and conditioning on previously committed actions via inference-time inpainting. However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE-VLA: Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05693v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhiyingDu/HiMoE-VLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world, increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method, real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and "inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast, performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the presence of significant latency.

| **[Evo-1: Lightweight Vision-Language-Action Model with Preserved Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04555v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks. In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1 achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite, surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations, Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/Evo-1</p></details> |
| **[SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07820v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited set of behaviors, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leveraging dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/SONIC/</p></details> |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GigaBrain-0: A World Model-Powered Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19430v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[E3AD: An Emotion-Aware Vision-Language-Action Model for Human-Centric End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04733v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Humanoid: Robotize Human Videos to Generate Humanoid Videos at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04537v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language-Action Models for Selective Robotic Disassembly: A Case Study on Critical Component Extraction from Desktops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04446v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Vision Language Action Model Using Success and Failure Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03913v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vine-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Diagnose, Correct, and Learn from Manipulation Failures via Visual Symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02787v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

| **[FPC-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework with a Supervisor for Failure Prediction and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04018v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Models Are More Generalizable Than You Think: Revisiting Physical and Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02902v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.</p></details> |  |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Vision-Language-Action Models as Anti-Exploration: A Test-Time Scaling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02834v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.</p></details> | 27 Pages, 21 figures |
| **[AVA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action models with Active Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18960v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

It uses the open-source pi05_base model as a foundation and preprocesses svla_so101_pickplace into a training dataset. The researcher independently designed an architecture for a vision-language-action model that combines deep semantic understanding and association to achieve telepathic communication. The training process involved repeated optimizations of data preprocessing, LoRA fine-tuning, and the inference-stage adapter. The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged. It demonstrates that mind-responsive alignment control is quantified through an architecture that combines deep understanding of semantics and association without retraining the base model, which provides reproducible experience for semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior in humanoid robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The S...</summary><p>The Sigma model has been open-sourced on Hugging Face.

However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiG-Flow: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01715v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobustVLA: Robustness-Aware Reinforcement Post-Training for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01331v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful general-purpose policies for robotic manipulation, benefiting from large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, they often fail to generalize reliably in out-of-distribution deployments, where unavoidable disturbances such as observation noise, sensor errors, or actuation perturbations become prevalent. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training provides a practical means to adapt pre-trained VLA models, existing methods mainly emphasize reward maximization and overlook robustness to environmental uncertainty. In this work, we introduce RobustVLA, a lightweight online RL post-training method designed to explicitly enhance the resilience of VLA models. Through a systematic robustness analysis, we identify two key regularizations: Jacobian regularization, which mitigates sensitivity to observation noise, and smoothness regularization, which stabilizes policies under action perturbations. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic environments demonstrate that RobustVLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reliability. Our results highlight the importance of principled robustness-aware RL post-training as a key step toward improving the reliability and robustness of VLA models.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://isee-laboratory.github.io/OmniDexGrasp/</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.</p></details> |  |

GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions.

Vision-language models offer strong semantic understanding but lack embodiment-aware action capabilities while relying on hand-crafted skills. Vision-Language-Action policies enable reactive manipulation but remain brittle across embodiments, weak in geometric grounding, and devoid of proactive collaboration mechanisms. These limitations indicate that scaling a single model alone cannot deliver reliable autonomy for service robots operating in human-populated settings. To address this gap, we present InteractGen, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation, treating foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective. Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration, providing evidence that multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.</p></details> |  |

This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mm-robot.github.io/distill_latent_action/</p></details> |

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.</p></details> | 12 figures, 2 tables |
| **[Improving Robotic Manipulation Robustness via NICE Scene Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22777v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation remains a challenge in real-world settings, where visual distractors can significantly degrade performance and safety. In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets. Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%.</p></details> | 11 figures, 3 tables |
| **[Mechanistic Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Models via Few-Shot Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22697v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Success: Refining Elegant Robot Manipulation from Mixed-Quality Data via Just-in-Time Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22555v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled notable progress in general-purpose robotic manipulation, yet their learned policies often exhibit variable execution quality. We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks. The proposed model enables robotic control that values not only whether tasks succeed, but also how they are performed.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoT4AD: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Explicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22532v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualVLA: Building a Generalizable Embodied Agent via Partial Decoupling of Reasoning and Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22134v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs (\eg, $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising. We address this challenge with $π_{\texttt{RL}}$, an open-source framework for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ implements two RL algorithms: (1) \textbf{Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) \textbf{Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration. We evaluate $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ on LIBERO, ManiSkill, and MetaWorld benchmarks. On LIBERO, $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $π_0$ and $π_{0.5}$ from 57.6\% to 97.6\% and from 77.1\% to 98.3\%, respectively. On ManiSkill, we train $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $π_0$ from 38.4\% to 78.8\% and $π_{0.5}$ from 40.1\% to 90.8\% across 4352 variations of pick-and-place task. On MetaWorld, RL is conducted over 50 different manipulation tasks and yields performance gains of 35.0\% and 26.9\% for $π_0$ and $π_{0.5}$ models, respectively. Overall, $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress. 27 pages</p></details> |

Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that learns features to predict object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of contact from egocentric images. We then use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across 4 existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of 4 challenging simulation tasks requiring fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a 17 DoF dexterous robotic hand, whereas the simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work. We additionally showcase the efficacy of our model on an egocentric contact point prediction task, validating its usefulness beyond dexterous manipulation policy learning.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving such control often requires multiple actuators, which increases mechanical complexity, complicates control systems, and raises energy consumption. Here, we introduce an inchworm-inspired soft robot whose locomotion direction is controlled passively by patterned substrates. The robot employs a single rolled dielectric elastomer actuator, while groove patterns on a 3D-printed substrate guide its alignment and trajectory. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that varying groove angles enables precise control of locomotion direction without the need for complex actuation strategies. This groove-guided approach reduces energy consumption, simplifies robot design, and expands the applicability of bio-inspired soft robots in fields such as search and rescue, pipe inspection, and planetary exploration.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Learning network that fuses two types of visual signals, event-based data and RGB frame data. The proposed Bimodal SegNet network has two distinct encoders, one for each signal input and a spatial pyramidal pooling with atrous convolutions. Encoders capture rich contextual information by pooling the concatenated features at different resolutions while the decoder obtains sharp object boundaries. The evaluation of the proposed method undertakes five unique image degradation challenges including occlusion, blur, brightness, trajectory and scale variance on the Event-based Segmentation (ESD) Dataset. The evaluation results show a 6-10\% segmentation accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean intersection over the union and pixel accuracy. The model code is available at https://github.com/sanket0707/Bimodal-SegNet.git</p></details> | 8 Pages |

Previous efforts in representation learning do not attempt to jointly capture structured periodic patterns and irregular variations in human and animal movement. To address this, we present Multi-Domain Motion Embedding (MDME), a motion representation that unifies the embedding of structured and unstructured features using a wavelet-based encoder and a probabilistic embedding in parallel. This produces a rich representation of reference motions from a minimal input set, enabling improved generalization across diverse motion styles and morphologies. We evaluate MDME on retargeting-free real-time motion imitation by conditioning robot control policies on the learned embeddings, demonstrating accurate reproduction of complex trajectories on both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Our comparative studies confirm that MDME outperforms prior approaches in reconstruction fidelity and generalizability to unseen motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDME can reproduce novel motion styles in real-time through zero-shot deployment, eliminating the need for task-specific tuning or online retargeting. These results position MDME as a generalizable and structure-aware foundation for scalable real-time robot imitation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.</p></details> |  |

SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.</p></details> | Technical Report |

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is currently under review</p></details> |

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are the author team of the paper "RealD$^2$iff: Bridging Real-World Gap in Robot Manipulation via Depth Diffusion".

| **[Affordance Field Intervention: Enabling VLAs to Escape Memory Traps in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07472v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great performance in robotic manipulation by mapping visual observations and language instructions directly to actions. However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the "Memory Trap". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Gradient by Gradient: Decentralised Energy Functions for Bimanual Robot Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04696v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many challenges in bimanual assembly, including high-level sequencing, multi-robot coordination, and low-level, contact-rich operations such as component mating. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods, while effective in this domain, may be prohibitively slow to converge when adapting to disturbances that require new task sequencing and optimisation. These events are common during tight-tolerance assembly, where difficult-to-model dynamics such as friction or deformation require rapid replanning and reattempts. Moreover, defining explicit task sequences for assembly can be cumbersome, limiting flexibility when task replanning is required. To simplify this planning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a piecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of adaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only myopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates effectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity of the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual assembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these experiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework generates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an emergent fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot locomotion, individual skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging to the same robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained weights are then loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed method with 9 distinct robot locomotion RL environments comprising 3 different robot embodiments, showing significant benefits of this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average improves sample efficiency by 36.9% and task performance by 7.3% compared to random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of this method.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explicitly build a topological model of the configuration space of a tethered robot starting from a polygonal representation of the workspace where the robot moves. To do so, we first establish a link between the configuration space of the tethered robot and the universal covering space of the workspace, and then we exploit this link to develop an algorithm to compute a simplicial complex model of the configuration space. We show how this approach improves the performances of existing algorithms that build other types of representations of the configuration space. The proposed model can be computed in a fraction of the time required to build traditional homotopy-augmented graphs, and is continuous, allowing to solve the path planning task for tethered robots using a broad set of path planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IFAC World Congress 2026</p></details> |

However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented.

Drawing on a five-day Wizard-of-Oz deployment of a mobile service robot in a university cafe, we analyze how people signal interaction readiness through nonverbal behaviors and how expert wizards use these cues to guide engagement. Motivated by these observations, we propose a two-stage pipeline in which lightweight perceptual detectors (gaze shifts and proxemics) are used to selectively trigger heavier video-based vision-language model (VLM) queries at socially meaningful moments. We evaluate this pipeline on replayed field interactions and compare two prompting strategies. Our findings suggest that selectively using VLMs as proxies for social reasoning enables socially responsive robot behavior, allowing robots to act appropriately by attending to the cues people naturally provide in real-world interactions.</p></details> |  |

The communication topology is directed, weighted and has a spanning tree with the leader being the root. By reformulating the time-varying formation tracking control objective as a constrained equation and transforming the region constraint by a diffeomorphism, the time-varying formation tracking controller with the region constraint is designed under the generalized Udwadia-Kalaba framework. Compared with the existing works on time-varying formation tracking control, the region constraint is takeninto account in this paper, which ensures the safety of the robots.Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |
| **[Surrogate compliance modeling enables reinforcement learned locomotion gaits for soft robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07114v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive morphogenetic robots adapt their morphology and control policies to meet changing tasks and environmental conditions. Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines. Field experiments with the robot further demonstrate stable, multi-gait locomotion across diverse natural terrains, including gravel, grass, and mud.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible Funnel-Shaped Robotic Hand with an Integrated Single-Sheet Valve for Milligram-Scale Powder Handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07091v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laboratory Automation (LA) has the potential to accelerate solid-state materials discovery by enabling continuous robotic operation without human intervention. While robotic systems have been developed for tasks such as powder grinding and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, fully automating powder handling at the milligram scale remains a significant challenge due to the complex flow dynamics of powders and the diversity of laboratory tasks. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel, funnel-shaped, flexible robotic hand that preserves the softness and conical sheet designs in prior work while incorporating a controllable valve at the cone apex to enable precise, incremental dispensing of milligram-scale powder quantities. The hand is integrated with an external balance through a feedback control system based on a model of powder flow and online parameter identification. Experimental evaluations with glass beads, monosodium glutamate, and titanium dioxide demonstrated that 80% of the trials achieved an error within 2 mg, and the maximum error observed was approximately 20 mg across a target range of 20 mg to 3 g. In addition, by incorporating flow prediction models commonly used for hoppers and performing online parameter identification, the system is able to adapt to variations in powder dynamics. Compared to direct PID control, the proposed model-based control significantly improved both accuracy and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of the proposed system to enable efficient and flexible powder weighing, with scalability toward larger quantities and applicability to a broad range of laboratory automation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies (mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field, such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels. The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware robotic systems for emergency response.</p></details> |  |
| **[CERNet: Class-Embedding Predictive-Coding RNN for Unified Robot Motion, Recognition, and Confidence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07041v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots interacting with humans must not only generate learned movements in real-time, but also infer the intent behind observed behaviors and estimate the confidence of their own inferences. This paper proposes a unified model that achieves all three capabilities within a single hierarchical predictive-coding recurrent neural network (PC-RNN) equipped with a class embedding vector, CERNet, which leverages a dynamically updated class embedding vector to unify motor generation and recognition. The model operates in two modes: generation and inference. In the generation mode, the class embedding constrains the hidden state dynamics to a class-specific subspace; in the inference mode, it is optimized online to minimize prediction error, enabling real-time recognition. Validated on a humanoid robot across 26 kinesthetically taught alphabets, our hierarchical model achieves 76% lower trajectory reproduction error than a parameter-matched single-layer baseline, maintains motion fidelity under external perturbations, and infers the demonstrated trajectory class online with 68% Top-1 and 81% Top-2 accuracy. Furthermore, internal prediction errors naturally reflect the model's confidence in its recognition. This integration of robust generation, real-time recognition, and intrinsic uncertainty estimation within a compact PC-RNN framework offers a compact and extensible approach to motor memory in physical robots, with potential applications in intent-sensitive human-robot collaboration.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videovla-nips2025.github.io</p></details> |

One desirable personality trait in cooperative partners, known to improve task performance, is agreeableness. To explore the impact of large language models on personality modeling for robots, as well as the effect of agreeable and non-agreeable personalities in cooperative tasks, we conduct a two-part study. This includes an online pre-study for personality validation and a lab-based main study to evaluate the effects on likability, motivation, and task performance. The results demonstrate that the robot's agreeableness significantly enhances its likability. No significant difference in intrinsic motivation was observed between the two personality types. However, the findings suggest that a robot exhibiting agreeableness and openness to new experiences can enhance task performance. This study highlights the advantages of employing large language models for customized modeling of robot personalities and provides evidence that a carefully chosen agreeable robot personality can positively influence human perceptions and lead to greater success in cooperative scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Impact of Data and Model Scaling on High-Level Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09241v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scaling has long remained a critical bottleneck in robot learning. For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.</p></details> |  |

This study starts with a scoping review to identify discussions and potential concerns arising from interactions with robotic systems in the context of healthcare, education, and private homes. Two focus groups of technology ethics experts then validated a comprehensive list of key topics and values in human-robot interaction (HRI) literature in these contexts. These insights were integrated into the HRI Value Compass web tool, to help HRI researchers identify these values in robot design. The tool was evaluated in a pilot study. This work benefits the HRI community by highlighting key concerns in human-robot interactions and providing an instrument to help researchers design robots that align with human values, ensuring future robotic systems adhere to these values in social applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables; 4 appendices</p></details> |

In this work, we combine the scalability and speed of modern multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms with the dynamic-awareness of kinodynamic planners to address these limitations. To this end, we propose discontinuity-Bounded LaCAM (db-LaCAM), a planner that utilizes a precomputed set of motion primitives that respect robot dynamics to generate horizon-length motion sequences, while allowing a user-defined discontinuity between successive motions. The planner db-LaCAM is resolution-complete with respect to motion primitives and supports arbitrary robot dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that db-LaCAM scales efficiently to scenarios with up to 50 robots, achieving up to ten times faster runtime compared to state-of-the-art planners, while maintaining comparable solution quality. The approach is validated in both 2D and 3D environments with dynamics such as the unicycle and 3D double integrator. We demonstrate the safe execution of trajectories planned with db-LaCAM in two distinct physical experiments involving teams of flying robots and car-with-trailer robots.</p></details> |  |

Existing video generation models for this domain are limited to synthesizing short clips of simple actions and often rely on manually defined trajectories. To this end, we introduce MIND-V, a hierarchical framework designed to synthesize physically plausible and logically coherent videos of long-horizon robotic manipulation. Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward. PFC leverages the V-JEPA world model to enforce physical plausibility by aligning the predicted and actual dynamic evolutions in the feature space. MIND-V demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation video generation, establishing a scalable and controllable paradigm for embodied data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error-Centric PID Untrained Neural-Net (EC-PIDUNN) For Nonlinear Robotics Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06578v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control has been widely successful across various industrial systems such as chemical processes, robotics, and power systems. However, as these systems evolved, the increase in the nonlinear dynamics and the complexity of interconnected variables have posed challenges that classical PID cannot effectively handle, often leading to instability, overshooting, or prolonged settling times. Researchers have proposed PIDNN models that combine the function approximation capabilities of neural networks with PID control to tackle these nonlinear challenges. However, these models require extensive, highly refined training data and have significant computational costs, making them less favorable for real-world applications. In this paper, We propose a novel EC-PIDUNN architecture, which integrates an untrained neural network with an improved PID controller, incorporating a stabilizing factor (\(τ\)) to generate the control signal. Like classical PID, our architecture uses the steady-state error \(e_t\) as input bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the systems dynamics. By forming an input vector from \(e_t\) within the neural network, we increase the dimensionality of input allowing for richer data representation. Additionally, we introduce a vector of parameters \( ρ_t \) to shape the output trajectory and a \textit{dynamic compute} function to adjust the PID coefficients from predefined values. We validate the effectiveness of EC-PIDUNN on multiple nonlinear robotics applications: (1) nonlinear unmanned ground vehicle systems that represent the Ackermann steering mechanism and kinematics control, (2) Pan-Tilt movement system. In both tests, it outperforms classical PID in convergence and stability achieving a nearly critically damped response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoftComputing</p></details> |

This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system that enables humanoid robots to execute robust continual ball-kicking with adaptability to different ball-goal configurations. The system extends a typical teacher-student training framework -- in which a "teacher" policy is trained with ground truth state information and the "student" learns to mimic it with noisy, imperfect sensing -- by including four training stages: (1) long-distance ball chasing (teacher); (2) directional kicking (teacher); (3) teacher policy distillation (student); and (4) student adaptation and refinement (student). Key design elements -- including tailored reward functions, realistic noise modeling, and online constrained RL for adaptation and refinement -- are critical for closing the sim-to-real gap and sustaining performance under perceptual uncertainty. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and on a real robot demonstrate strong kicking accuracy and goal-scoring success across diverse ball-goal configurations. Ablation studies further highlight the necessity of the constrained RL, noise modeling, and the adaptation stage. This work presents a system for learning robust continual humanoid ball-kicking under imperfect perception, establishing a benchmark task for visuomotor skill learning in humanoid whole-body control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Referring Expression Comprehension in Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06558v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots enter human workspaces, there is a crucial need for them to comprehend embodied human instructions, enabling intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction (HRI). However, accurate comprehension is challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets that capture natural embodied interactions in diverse HRI settings. Existing datasets suffer from perspective bias, single-view collection, inadequate coverage of nonverbal gestures, and a predominant focus on indoor environments. To address these issues, we present the Refer360 dataset, a large-scale dataset of embodied verbal and nonverbal interactions collected across diverse viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additionally, we introduce MuRes, a multimodal guided residual module designed to improve embodied referring expression comprehension. MuRes acts as an information bottleneck, extracting salient modality-specific signals and reinforcing them into pre-trained representations to form complementary features for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four HRI datasets, including the Refer360 dataset, and demonstrate that current multimodal models fail to capture embodied interactions comprehensively; however, augmenting them with MuRes consistently improves performance. These findings establish Refer360 as a valuable benchmark and exhibit the potential of guided residual learning to advance embodied referring expression comprehension in robots operating within human environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, accepted at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) 2026</p></details> |

This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Virtual Model Control for Robotics: Design and Tuning of Passivity-Based Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06627v3)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Passivity-based control is a cornerstone of control theory and an established design approach in robotics. Its strength is based on the passivity theorem, which provides a powerful interconnection framework for robotics. However, the design of passivity-based controllers and their optimal tuning remain challenging. We propose here an intuitive design approach for fully actuated robots, where the control action is determined by a `virtual-mechanism' as in classical virtual model control. The result is a robot whose controlled behavior can be understood in terms of physics. We achieve optimal tuning by applying algorithmic differentiation to ODE simulations of the rigid body dynamics. Overall, this leads to a flexible design and optimization approach: stability is proven by passivity of the virtual mechanism, while performance is obtained by optimization using algorithmic differentiation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Robot Locomotion in Complex Terrains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06486v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning is the basis of both biological and artificial systems when it comes to mimicking intelligent behaviors. From the classical PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), there is a series of deep reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used in training locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots because of their stability and sample efficiency. However, among all these variants, experiments and simulations often converge prematurely, leading to suboptimal locomotion and reduced task performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation (ECIM), an entropy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in contrast with the PPO series, that can reduce premature convergence by combining intrinsic motivation with adaptive exploration. For experiments, in order to parallel with other baselines, we chose to apply it in Isaac Gym across six terrain categories: upward slopes, downward slopes, uneven rough terrain, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and flat ground as widely used. For comparison, our experiments consistently achieve better performance: task rewards increase by 4--12%, peak body pitch oscillation is reduced by 23--29%, joint acceleration decreases by 20--32%, and joint torque consumption declines by 11--20%. Overall, our model ECIM, by combining entropy control and intrinsic motivation control, achieves better results in stability across different terrains for quadrupedal locomotion, and at the same time reduces energetic cost and makes it a practical choice for complex robotic control tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current fault tolerant control (FTC) schemes for MWMRs target complete actuator failures like motor stall, ignoring partial faults e.g., in torque degradation. We propose an FTC strategy handling both fault types, where we adopt posterior probability to learn real-time fault parameters. We derive the FTC law by aggregating probability-weighed control laws corresponding to predefined faults. This ensures the robustness and safety of MWMR control despite varying levels of fault occurrence. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our FTC under diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables both temporal and state-space parallelization by incorporating a parallel associative scan to solve the primal-dual Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system. In this way, the optimal control problem is solved in $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(n)\log{N} + \log^2(m))$ complexity, instead of $\mathcal{O}(N(n + m)^3)$, where $n$, $m$, and $N$ are the dimension of the system state, control vector, and the length of the prediction horizon. We demonstrate the advantages of this implementation over two state-of-the-art solvers (acados and crocoddyl), achieving up to a 60\% improvement in runtime for Whole Body Dynamics (WB)-MPC and a 700\% improvement for Single Rigid Body Dynamics (SRBD)-MPC when varying the prediction horizon length. The presented formulation scales efficiently with the problem state dimensions as well, enabling the definition of a centralized controller for up to 16 legged robots that can be computed in less than 25 ms. Furthermore, thanks to the JAX implementation, the solver supports large-scale parallelization across multiple environments, allowing the possibility of performing learning with the MPC in the loop directly in GPU.

Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI) technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance characteristics are experimentally verified.</p></details> |  |

The entire operation takes place over a bandwidth-limited communication channel, which motivates the problem of determining what and how much information the assisting agent should transmit and when while simultaneously performing exploration/mapping. The proposed framework enables the assisting aerial agent to decide what information to transmit based on the Value-of-Information (VoI), how much to transmit using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), and how to acquire additional information through an utility score-based environment exploration strategy. We perform a communication-motion trade-off analysis between the total amount of map data communicated by the aerial agent and the navigation cost incurred by the ground agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference</p></details> |

To overcome this, methods excluding electronics from the operating environment while retaining advanced electronic control and actuation have been explored. These include the remote hydraulic drive of electronics-free mobile robots, which offer high reachability, and long wire-driven robot arms with motors consolidated at the base, which offer high environmental resistance. To combine the advantages of both, this study proposes a new system, "Remote Wire Drive." As a proof-of-concept, we designed and developed the Remote Wire-Driven robot "REWW-ARM", which consists of the following components: 1) a novel power transmission mechanism, the "Remote Wire Transmission Mechanism" (RWTM), the key technology of the Remote Wire Drive; 2) an electronics-free distal mobile robot driven by it; and 3) a motor-unit that generates power and provides electronic closed-loop control based on state estimation via the RWTM. In this study, we evaluated the mechanical and control performance of REWW-ARM through several experiments, demonstrating its capability for locomotion, posture control, and object manipulation both on land and underwater. This suggests the potential for applying the Remote Wire-Driven system to various types of robots, thereby expanding their operational range.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> |

There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive human study involving interviews with 26 guide dog handlers, four white cane users, nine guide dog trainers, and one O\&M trainer, along with 15+ hours of observing guide dog-assisted walking. After de-identification, we open-sourced the dataset to promote human-centered development and informed decision-making for assistive systems for BLV people. Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs.</p></details> |  |

| **[3D Path Planning for Robot-assisted Vertebroplasty from Arbitrary Bi-plane X-ray via Differentiable Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05803v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are transforming image-guided interventions by enhancing accuracy and minimizing radiation exposure. A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.</p></details> |  |

We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot.

Moreover, as battery energy densities continue to rise, improper handling during recycling poses significant safety hazards, including potential fires at recycling facilities. Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-powered object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO, ResNets). Despite advances in optimizing detection techniques and model modifications, a fully autonomous solution capable of accurately identifying and sorting batteries across diverse WEEEs types has yet to be realized. In response to these challenges, we present our novel approach which integrates a specialized X-ray transmission dual energy imaging subsystem with advanced pre-processing algorithms, enabling high-contrast image reconstruction for effective differentiation of dense and thin materials in WEEE. Devices move along a conveyor belt through a high-resolution X-ray imaging system, where YOLO and U-Net models precisely detect and segment battery-containing items. An intelligent tracking and position estimation algorithm then guides a Delta robot equipped with a suction gripper to selectively extract and properly discard the targeted devices. The approach is validated in a photorealistic simulation environment developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on the real setup.</p></details> |  |

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

However, its integration with robotic grasping systems has so far been explored due to the deployment complexities and prohibitive costs. Within this paper, we introduce a novel hyperspectral imaging-guided robotic grasping system. The system consists of PRISM (Polyhedral Reflective Imaging Scanning Mechanism) and the SpectralGrasp framework. PRISM is designed to enable high-precision, distortion-free hyperspectral imaging while simplifying system integration and costs. SpectralGrasp generates robotic grasping strategies by effectively leveraging both the spatial and spectral information from hyperspectral images. The proposed system demonstrates substantial improvements in both textile recognition compared to human performance and sorting success rate compared to RGB-based methods. Additionally, a series of comparative experiments further validates the effectiveness of our system.

The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-GAR: A Hierarchical Interaction Framework via Goal-Driven Observation-Action Refinement for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17079v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified video and action prediction models hold great potential for robotic manipulation, as future observations offer contextual cues for planning, while actions reveal how interactions shape the environment. However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/H-GAR</p></details> |

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating semantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

We present \textit{CLIO}, a tour guide robot with co-speech actions to direct visitors' visual attention and thus enhance the overall user engagement in a guided tour. \textit{CLIO} is equipped with designed actions to engage visitors. It builds eye contact with the visitor through tracking a visitor's face and blinking its eyes, or orient their attention by its head movement and laser pointer. We further use a Large Language Model (LLM) to coordinate the designed actions with a given narrative script for exhibition. We conducted a user study to evaluate the \textit{CLIO} system in a mock-up exhibition of historical photographs. We collected feedback from questionnaires and quantitative data from a mobile eye tracker. Experimental results validated that the engaging actions are well designed and demonstrated its efficacy in guiding visual attention of the visitors. It was evidenced that \textit{CLIO} achieved an enhanced engagement compared to the baseline system with only audio guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, human-robot interaction</p></details> |

WiSER-X relies only on local inter-robot relative position estimates, that can be obtained by exchanging signal pings from onboard sensors such as WiFi, Ultra-Wide Band, amongst others, to inform the exploration decisions of individual robots to minimize redundant coverage overlaps. Furthermore, WiSER-X also enables asynchronous termination without requiring a shared map between the robots. It also adapts to heterogeneous robot behaviors and even complete failures in unknown environment while ensuring complete coverage. Simulations show that WiSER-X leads to 58% lower overlap than a zero-information-sharing baseline algorithm-1 and only 23% more overlap than a full-information-sharing algorithm baseline algorithm-2. Hardware experiments further validate the feasibility of WiSER-X using full onboard sensing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Relational Visual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07833v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page, data, and code: https://thaoshibe.github.io/relsim</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p></details> |  |

We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |
| **[Structure-Aware Feature Rectification with Region Adjacency Graphs for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07360v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV2026 |

While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Accurate UAV Image Perception: Guiding Vision-Language Models with Stronger Task Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07302v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.</p></details> |  |

Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning.

To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate GRPO into SLT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of GRPO-based optimization in enhancing both translation quality and semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

Large vision-language models can generate captions but are designed for general visual understanding, not classifier-specific reasoning. Existing zero-shot explanation methods align global image features with language, producing descriptions of what is visible rather than what drives the prediction. We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning. A sparse autoencoder further improves interpretability, particularly for Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments show that TEXTER generates more faithful and interpretable explanations than existing methods. The code will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+6 ...</summary><p>11+6 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In light of this, we propose Dropout Prompt Learning, which aims for applying dropout to improve the robustness of the vision-language models. Different from the vanilla dropout, we apply dropout on the tokens of the textual and visual branches, where we evaluate the token significance considering both intra-modal context and inter-modal alignment, enabling flexible dropout probabilities for each token. Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization.</p></details> |  |

Similar to differential amplifiers, our FDA calculates the original and the function-word cross-attention within attention heads, and differentially subtracts the latter from the former for more aligned and robust VLMs. Comprehensive experiments include 2 SOTA baselines under 6 different attacks on 2 downstream tasks, 3 datasets, and 3 models. Overall, our FDA yields an average 18/13/53% ASR drop with only 0.2/0.3/0.6% performance drops on the 3 tested models on retrieval, and a 90% ASR drop with a 0.3% performance gain on visual grounding. We demonstrate the scalability, generalization, and zero-shot performance of FDA experimentally, as well as in-depth ablation studies and analysis.

This paper presents a comprehensive visual comparison between CLIP based and DINOv2 based approaches for 3D pose estimation in hand object grasping scenarios. We evaluate both models on the task of 6D object pose estimation and demonstrate their complementary strengths: CLIP excels in semantic understanding through language grounding, while DINOv2 provides superior dense geometric features. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that CLIP based methods achieve better semantic consistency, while DINOv2 based approaches demonstrate competitive performance with enhanced geometric precision. Our analysis provides insights for selecting appropriate vision models for robotic manipulation and grasping, picking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Poster |

We introduce MMRPT, a masked multimodal reinforcement pre-training framework that strengthens visual reasoning in MLLMs. We are the first to incorporate reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training of large vision-language models, enabling learning signals that reward visual grounding rather than caption imitation. MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward. Experiments show consistent zero-shot gains across diverse benchmarks and substantially improved robustness under supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating that reinforcement-driven masked reasoning provides a more reliable and generalizable pre-training objective for multimodal models.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figures |

However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page can be found at https://dinyudin203.github.io/uCLIP-project/</p></details> |
| **[Using Vision-Language Models as Proxies for Social Intelligence in Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07177v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in everyday environments must often decide when and whether to engage with people, yet such decisions often hinge on subtle nonverbal cues that unfold over time and are difficult to model explicitly. Drawing on a five-day Wizard-of-Oz deployment of a mobile service robot in a university cafe, we analyze how people signal interaction readiness through nonverbal behaviors and how expert wizards use these cues to guide engagement. Motivated by these observations, we propose a two-stage pipeline in which lightweight perceptual detectors (gaze shifts and proxemics) are used to selectively trigger heavier video-based vision-language model (VLM) queries at socially meaningful moments. We evaluate this pipeline on replayed field interactions and compare two prompting strategies. Our findings suggest that selectively using VLMs as proxies for social reasoning enables socially responsive robot behavior, allowing robots to act appropriately by attending to the cues people naturally provide in real-world interactions.</p></details> |  |

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://cmlab-korea.github.io/CHIMERA/</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/nsivaku/dart</p></details> |

Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEDI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Embodied Agents on UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18229v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces. To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we design a unified evaluation framework encompassing six core sub-skills: semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, task planning and action generation. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid testing platform that incorporates a wide range of both virtual and real-world scenarios, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-EAs across diverse contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization. By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field, BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for future development in this field. Our benchmark is now publicly available at https://github.com/lostwolves/BEDI.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoNeural: Co-Designing Vision-Language Models for NPU Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02924v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528v3)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM-Assisted Continual learning for Visual Question Answering in Self-Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00843v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in autonomous driving by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with continual learning. In autonomous driving, VQA plays a vital role in enabling the system to understand and reason about its surroundings. However, traditional models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when sequentially exposed to new driving tasks, such as perception, prediction, and planning, each requiring different forms of knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a novel continual learning framework that combines VLMs with selective memory replay and knowledge distillation, reinforced by task-specific projection layer regularization. The knowledge distillation allows a previously trained model to act as a "teacher" to guide the model through subsequent tasks, minimizing forgetting. Meanwhile, task-specific projection layers calculate the loss based on the divergence of feature representations, ensuring continuity in learning and reducing the shift between tasks. Evaluated on the DriveLM dataset, our framework shows substantial performance improvements, with gains ranging from 20.11% to 35.16% across various metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining continual learning with VLMs in enhancing the resilience and reliability of VQA systems in autonomous driving. We will release our source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural and Disentangled Adaptation of Large Vision Language Models for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06883v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation enhances accuracy by leveraging visual and textual signals, and its success largely depends on learning high-quality cross-modal representations. Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer unified multimodal representation learning, making them a promising backbone. However, applying LVLMs to recommendation remains challenging due to (i) representation misalignment, where domain gaps between item data and general pre-training lead to unaligned embedding spaces, and (ii) gradient conflicts during fine-tuning, where shared adapters cause interference and a lack of discriminative power. To address this, we propose SDA, a lightweight framework for Structural and Disentangled Adaptation, which integrates two components: Cross-Modal Structural Alignment (CMSA) and Modality-Disentangled Adaptation. CMSA aligns embeddings using intra-modal structures as a soft teacher, while MoDA mitigates gradient conflicts via expertized, gated low-rank paths to disentangle gradient flows. Experiments on three public Amazon datasets show SDA integrates seamlessly with existing multimodal and sequential recommenders, yielding average gains of 6.15% in Hit@10 and 8.64% in NDCG@10. It also achieves up to 12.83% and 18.70% gains on long-tail items with minimal inference overhead.

We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks. Second, to increase the diversity of training data, DoGe constructs an evolving curriculum learning pipeline: an expanded native domain knowledge corpus and an iteratively evolving seed problems pool. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline across various benchmarks, providing a scalable pathway for realizing self-evolving LVLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026(Oral)</p></details> |

Still, these models can make distinctly unnatural errors, for example, providing (wrong) answers to unanswerable VQA questions, such as questions asking about objects that do not appear in the image. To address this issue, we propose CLIP-UP: CLIP-based Unanswerable Problem detection, a novel lightweight method for equipping VLMs with the ability to withhold answers to unanswerable questions. CLIP-UP leverages CLIP-based similarity measures to extract question-image alignment information to detect unanswerability, requiring efficient training of only a few additional layers, while keeping the original VLMs' weights unchanged. Tested across several models, CLIP-UP achieves significant improvements on benchmarks assessing unanswerability in both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA, surpassing other methods, while preserving original performance on other tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

We argue that this problem mainly stems from the asymmetric properties between images and text. To enrich the spatial understanding ability of vision-language models, we propose a simple, annotation-free, plug-and-play method named $\text{Stitch and Tell}$ (abbreviated as SiTe), which injects structured spatial supervision into data. It constructs stitched image-text pairs by stitching images along a spatial axis and generating spatially-aware captions or question answer pairs based on the layout of stitched image, without relying on costly advanced models or human involvement. We evaluate SiTe across three architectures including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B and HALVA-7B, two training datasets, and eight benchmarks. Experiments show that SiTe improves spatial understanding tasks such as $\text{MME}_{\text{Position}}$ (+5.50%) and Spatial-MM (+4.19%), while maintaining or improving performance on general vision-language benchmarks including COCO-QA (+1.02%) and MMBench (+4.76%). Our findings suggest that explicitly injecting spatially-aware structure into training data offers an effective way to mitigate spatial hallucinations and improve spatial understanding, while preserving general vision-language capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisChainBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Turn, Multi-Image Visual Reasoning Beyond Language Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06759v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-image, multi-turn scenarios is a critical yet underexplored capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on static or horizontal comparisons -- e.g., spotting visual differences or assessing appropriateness -- while relying heavily on language cues. Such settings overlook progressive, context-dependent reasoning and the challenge of visual-to-visual inference. To bridge this gap, we present VisChainBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning across sequential, interdependent tasks with minimal language guidance. VisChainBench contains 1,457 tasks spanning over 20,000 images across three diverse domains (e.g., daily scenarios, engineering troubleshooting), structured to mimic real-world decision-making processes. Uniquely, the benchmark is constructed using a multi-agent generation pipeline, ensuring high visual diversity and controlled language bias.

| **[UARE: A Unified Vision-Language Model for Image Quality Assessment, Restoration, and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06750v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) and image restoration are fundamental problems in low-level vision. Although IQA and restoration are closely connected conceptually, most existing work treats them in isolation. Recent advances in unified multimodal understanding-generation models demonstrate promising results and indicate that stronger understanding can improve generative performance. This motivates a single model that unifies IQA and restoration and explicitly studies how IQA can guide restoration, a setting that remains largely underexplored yet highly valuable. In this paper, we propose UARE, to our knowledge the first Unified vision-language model for image quality Assessment, Restoration, and Enhancement. Built on pretrained unified understanding and generation models, we introduce a two-stage training framework. First, a progressive, easy-to-hard schedule expands from single-type distortions to higher-order mixed degradations, enabling UARE to handle multiple degradations. Second, we perform unified fine-tuning of quality understanding and restoration with interleaved text-image data, aligning IQA signals with restoration objectives. Through multi-task co-training, UARE leverages IQA to boost restoration and enhancement performance. Extensive experiments across IQA, restoration, and enhancement tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of UARE. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/UARE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Model Alignment: A Simple Path to Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06746v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for AI-generated images (AIGI) detection, yet converting VLMs into detectors requires substantial resource, while the resulting models still exhibit severe hallucinations. To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoT4Det: A Chain-of-Thought Framework for Perception-Oriented Vision-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06663v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in a broad range of vision-language tasks, such as general visual question answering and optical character recognition (OCR). However, their performance on perception-centric tasks -- such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation -- remains significantly inferior to that of task-specific expert models. For example, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves only 19% mAP on COCO2017 val, particularly struggling with dense scenes and small object recall. In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Thought for Detection (CoT4Det), a simple but efficient strategy that reformulates perception tasks into three interpretable steps: classification, counting, and grounding -- each more naturally aligned with the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception performance without compromising general vision language capabilities. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, CoT4Det boosts mAP from 19.0% to 33.0% on COCO2017 val and achieves competitive results across a variety of perception benchmarks, outperforming baselines by +2% on RefCOCO series and 19% on Flickr30k entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Image Descriptions from Attention Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06662v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People can view the same image differently: they focus on different regions, objects, and details in varying orders and describe them in distinct linguistic styles. This leads to substantial variability in image descriptions. However, existing models for personalized image description focus on linguistic style alone, with no prior work leveraging individual viewing patterns. We address this gap by explicitly modeling personalized viewing behavior as a core factor in description generation. Our method, DEPER (DEscription-PERception persona encoder), learns a subject embedding that captures both linguistic style and viewing behavior, guided by an auxiliary attention-prediction task. A lightweight adapter aligns these embeddings with a frozen vision-language model, enabling few-shot personalization without retraining. Across four datasets spanning diverse viewing tasks and both short and detailed descriptions, DEPER achieves a 24% average improvement, showing that modeling personalized attention produces more human-aligned and high-quality descriptions. We posit that understanding how people see helps predict what they say; modeling human diversity in perception can improve both performance and human alignment in multimodal systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards Cross-View Point Correspondence in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04686v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view correspondence is a fundamental capability for spatial understanding and embodied AI. However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence. The benchmark, dataset, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/WangYipu2002/CrossPoint.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIND-V: Hierarchical Video Generation for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation with RL-based Physical Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06628v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied imitation learning is constrained by the scarcity of diverse, long-horizon robotic manipulation data. Existing video generation models for this domain are limited to synthesizing short clips of simple actions and often rely on manually defined trajectories. To this end, we introduce MIND-V, a hierarchical framework designed to synthesize physically plausible and logically coherent videos of long-horizon robotic manipulation. Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward. PFC leverages the V-JEPA world model to enforce physical plausibility by aligning the predicted and actual dynamic evolutions in the feature space. MIND-V demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation video generation, establishing a scalable and controllable paradigm for embodied data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedGRPO: Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Medical Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06581v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models struggle with medical video understanding, where spatial precision, temporal reasoning, and clinical semantics are critical. To address this, we first introduce \textbf{MedVidBench}, a large-scale benchmark of 531,850 video-instruction pairs across 8 medical sources spanning video, segment, and frame-level tasks, curated through a rigorous quality assurance pipeline with expert-guided prompting and dual-model validation. While supervised fine-tuning on MedVidBench yields noticeable gains, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) fails due to imbalanced reward scales across datasets, which destabilizes optimization and leads to training collapse. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{MedGRPO}, a novel RL framework for balanced multi-dataset training with two key innovations: (1) \emph{cross-dataset reward normalization} that maps each dataset's median performance to a common reward value, ensuring fair optimization regardless of difficulty, and (2) a \emph{medical LLM judge} that evaluates caption quality on five clinical dimensions through comparative similarity scoring. Supervised fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MedVidBench substantially outperforms GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash across all tasks, demonstrating MedVidBench's efficacy, while our MedGRPO framework further improves upon the SFT baseline across grounding and captioning tasks. Our work establishes a foundational benchmark and robust training methodology for advancing vision-language models in medical domains.

| **[Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing surveys focus on limited techniques, missing an overall field view and understanding method interconnections. In contrast, our study offers a unified review, covering about 40 representative methods across Hand-crafted, Distribution-hypothesis-based, Generative models (GM)-based, and Vision-language models (VLM)-based synthesis. We introduce the first industrial anomaly synthesis (IAS) taxonomy. Prior works lack formal classification or use simplistic taxonomies, hampering structured comparisons and trend identification. Our taxonomy provides a fine-grained framework reflecting methodological progress and practical implications, grounding future research. Furthermore, we explore cross-modality synthesis and large-scale VLM. Previous surveys overlooked multimodal data and VLM in anomaly synthesis, limiting insights into their advantages. Our survey analyzes their integration, benefits, challenges, and prospects, offering a roadmap to boost IAS with multimodal learning.

| **[Are AI-Generated Driving Videos Ready for Autonomous Driving? A Diagnostic Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06376v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-video models have enabled the generation of high-resolution driving scenes from natural language prompts. These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCAD: Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Parametric CAD Model Generation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06328v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ReCAD, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that bootstraps pretrained large models (PLMs) to generate precise parametric computer-aided design (CAD) models from multimodal inputs by leveraging their inherent generative capabilities. With just access to simple functional interfaces (e.g., point coordinates), our approach enables the emergence of complex CAD operations (e.g., pattern replication and mirror). This stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically rely on knowledge injected through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), offer limited support for editability, and fail to exploit the strong generative priors of PLMs. Specifically, the ReCAD framework begins by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to equip them with basic CAD model generation capabilities, where we rewrite CAD scripts into parameterized code that is leveraged to generate accurate textual descriptions for supervision. Then, we propose a novel RL strategy that incorporates parameterized code as guidance to enhance the model's reasoning on challenging questions. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical primitive learning process to progressively teach structured and compositional skills under a unified reward function that ensures both geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity. ReCAD sets a new state-of-the-art in both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, significantly improving geometric accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. In the image-to-CAD task, for instance, it reduces the mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution), outperforming existing baselines by a substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral presentation at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Knowing the Answer Isn't Enough: Fixing Reasoning Path Failures in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06258v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We reveal a critical yet underexplored flaw in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs): even when these models know the correct answer, they frequently arrive there through incorrect reasoning paths. The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought. Our code will be available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/PSO.</p></details> |  |

We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often rely on passive observation of spatial data, failing to internalize an active mental imagery process. To bridge this gap, we propose SpatialDreamer, a reinforcement learning framework that enables spatial reasoning through a closedloop process of active exploration, visual imagination via a world model, and evidence-grounded reasoning. To address the lack of fine-grained reward supervision in longhorizontal reasoning tasks, we propose Geometric Policy Optimization (GeoPO), which introduces tree-structured sampling and step-level reward estimation with geometric consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialDreamer delivers highly competitive results across multiple challenging benchmarks, signifying a critical advancement in human-like active spatial mental simulation for MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing through Imagination: Learning Scene Geometry via Implicit Spatial World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01821v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed. This report serves as a preliminary study for future developments in KAN-based world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our project page: https://longhz140516.github.io/MajutsuCity/.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Memory: A comparison of memory mechanisms in world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06983v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models enable agents to plan within imagined environments by predicting future states conditioned on past observations and actions. However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs.

However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain. In contrast, human drivers are able to recall road structure even under poor visibility. To endow models with this ``recall" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks. For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling. Extensive experiments show that the extended modality could enhance the performance of certain tasks. We will open-source dataset curation code, data, and benchmarks for further study of this new autonomous driving paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo Page: https://spatialretrievalad.github.io/ with open sourced code, dataset, and checkpoints</p></details> |
| **[Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391v3)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing video generation models for this domain are limited to synthesizing short clips of simple actions and often rely on manually defined trajectories. To this end, we introduce MIND-V, a hierarchical framework designed to synthesize physically plausible and logically coherent videos of long-horizon robotic manipulation. Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward. PFC leverages the V-JEPA world model to enforce physical plausibility by aligning the predicted and actual dynamic evolutions in the feature space. MIND-V demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation video generation, establishing a scalable and controllable paradigm for embodied data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Manifold Part 2: Neural Network Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06563v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops the global equations of neural networks through stacked piecewise manifolds, fixed-point theory, and boundary-conditioned iteration. Once fixed coordinates and operators are removed, a neural network appears as a learnable numerical computation shaped by manifold complexity, high-order nonlinearity, and boundary conditions. Real-world data impose strong data complexity, near-infinite scope, scale, and minibatch fragmentation, while training dynamics produce learning complexity through shifting node covers, curvature accumulation, and the rise and decay of plasticity. These forces constrain learnability and explain why capability emerges only when fixed-point regions stabilize. Neural networks do not begin with fixed points; they construct them through residual-driven iteration. This perspective clarifies the limits of monolithic models under geometric and data-induced plasticity and motivates architectures and federated systems that distribute manifold complexity across many elastic models, forming a coherent world-modeling framework grounded in geometry, algebra, fixed points, and real-data complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARSS: Taming Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation for View Synthesis From Single View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23008v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in world modeling tasks, including novel view generation from sparse inputs. However, most existing diffusion-based NVS methods generate target views jointly via an iterative denoising process, which makes it less straightforward to impose a strictly causal structure along a camera trajectory. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce ARSS, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ an off-the-shelf video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose an autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves overall performance comparable to state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models.

Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://playerone-hku.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SIMPACT: Simulation-Enabled Action Planning using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05955v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable common-sense and semantic reasoning capabilities. However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

| **[World Models That Know When They Don't Know: Controllable Video Generation with Calibrated Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05927v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARTAN: A Sparse Transformer World Model Attending to What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06890v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the interactions between entities in a structured way plays a central role in world models that flexibly adapt to changes in the environment. Recent works motivate the benefits of models that explicitly represent the structure of interactions and formulate the problem as discovering local causal structures. In this work, we demonstrate that reliably capturing these relationships in complex settings remains challenging. To remedy this shortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the discovery of such local structures. To this end, we present the SPARse TrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns context-dependent interaction structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity regularisation on the attention patterns between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN learns sparse, context-dependent interaction graphs that accurately predict future object states. We further extend our model to adapt to sparse interventions with unknown targets in the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly interpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically, we evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric world models in observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model can learn local causal graphs that accurately reflect the underlying interactions between objects, achieving significantly improved few-shot adaptation to dynamics changes, as well as robustness against distractors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the effectiveness of World Models for Spatial Reasoning through Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05809v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |

The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design.</p></details> |  |

This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems. This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown. We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.

| **[What-If Analysis of Large Language Models: Explore the Game World Using Proactive Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04791v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective at reasoning and information retrieval, but remain unreliable for decision-making in dynamic, partially observable, high-stakes environments such as MOBA games. One key limitation is weak counterfactual reasoning: LLMs struggle to conduct precise what-if analysis over candidate actions and their future consequences. We address this limitation with What-if Analysis LLM (WiA-LLM), a framework that trains an LLM as an explicit language-based world model. Instead of representing the environment in latent vectors, WiA-LLM models how the game state evolves over time with candidate actions using language, and provides textual justifications for these predicted outcomes. This explicit modeling supports (1) interpretability, since the model's predictions and underlying rationales are human-readable, and (2) semantic generalization, as the model can transfer knowledge across situations that share similar game concepts (e.g., roles, objectives, or tactics). WiA-LLM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on human-like reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards that depend on the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth future states. In the Honor of Kings (HoK) environment, WiA-LLM attains 74.2\% accuracy (27\%$\uparrow$ vs. base model) in forecasting game-state changes. In addition, we find that agents with WiA-LLM exhibit closer strategic behavior to expert players than purely reactive LLM agents, indicating more foresight-aware and expert-aligned decision-making.</p></details> |  |

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |

EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weights, and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (52 pages, 15 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Driving Beyond Privilege: Distilling Dense-Reward Knowledge into Sparse-Reward Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04279v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to exploit dense simulator-defined rewards in vision-based autonomous driving without inheriting their misalignment with deployment metrics. In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consisting of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-3d-4d-world-models</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey; 50 pages, 10 figures, 14 tables; GitHub Repo at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-3d-4d-world-models</p></details> |

While existing approaches use WFMs as synthetic data generators, they suffer from high computational costs and underutilization of pre-trained VLA policies. We introduce \textbf{AdaPower} (\textbf{Ada}pt and Em\textbf{power}), a lightweight adaptation framework that transforms general-purpose WFMs into specialist world models through two novel components: Temporal-Spatial Test-Time Training (TS-TTT) for inference-time adaptation and Memory Persistence (MP) for long-horizon consistency. Integrated within a Model Predictive Control framework, our adapted world model empowers pre-trained VLAs, achieving over 41\% improvement in task success rates on LIBERO benchmarks without policy retraining, while preserving computational efficiency and generalist capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models for Autonomous Navigation of Terrestrial Robots from LIDAR Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03429v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation of terrestrial robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL) from LIDAR observations remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of sensor data and the sample inefficiency of model-free approaches. Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems</p></details> |

We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/does-hearing-help-seeing/</p></details> |

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.</p></details> |  |

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Vehicle Dynamics Embedded World Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02417v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Massively Multitask World Models for Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19584v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://www.nicklashansen.com/NewtWM</p></details> |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation.

| **[WARPD: World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has become a promising approach for both manipulation and locomotion. Diffusion models are now widely used to train large, generalized policies that predict controls or trajectories, leveraging their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, this generality comes at the cost of larger model sizes and slower inference, an acute limitation for robotic tasks requiring high control frequencies. Moreover, Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular trajectory-generation approach, suffers from a trade-off between performance and action horizon: fewer diffusion queries lead to larger trajectory chunks, which in turn accumulate tracking errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce WARPD (World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion), a method that generates closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) directly, instead of open-loop trajectories. By learning behavioral distributions in parameter space rather than trajectory space, WARPD offers two major advantages: (1) extended action horizons with robustness to perturbations, while maintaining high task performance, and (2) significantly reduced inference costs. Empirically, WARPD outperforms DP in long-horizon and perturbed environments, and achieves multitask performance on par with DP while requiring only ~ 1/45th of the inference-time FLOPs per step.</p></details> |  |

Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSpace: Text-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis and Editing with Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02459v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture'), but lack editing functionality, are limited to rectangular layouts, or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that enables asset-agnostic deployment and frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a voxelization-based evaluation capturing fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on addition and achieve superior human-perceived quality on full scene synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures (incl. appendix)</p></details> |
