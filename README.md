| **[HyperVLA: Efficient Inference in Vision-Language-Action Models via Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04898v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

| **[ContextVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Amortized Multi-Frame Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04246v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models (VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this, ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced training and inference times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huiwon-jang.github.io/contextvla</p></details> |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SITCOM: Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04041v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust robotic control policies remains a major challenge due to the high cost of collecting labeled data, limited generalization to unseen environments, and difficulties in planning over long horizons. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs (SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using trained dynamics model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE). *Equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIBERO-PRO: Towards Robust and Fair Evaluation of Vision-Language-Action Models Beyond Memorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03827v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Zxy-MLlab/LIBERO-PRO.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[MM-Nav: Multi-View VLA Model for Robust Visual Navigation via Multi-Expert Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03142v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOTE: Vision-Language-Action Optimization with Trajectory Ensemble Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05116v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

| **[Gemini Robotics 1.5: Pushing the Frontier of Generalist Robots with Advanced Embodied Reasoning, Thinking, and Motion Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03342v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world, advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control. This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myungkyukoo.github.io/hamlet/</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[FailSafe: Reasoning and Recovery from Failures in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01642v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe/</p></details> |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

| **[INSIGHT: INference-time Sequence Introspection for Generating Help Triggers in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01389v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.</p></details> |  |

Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

| **[Hybrid Training for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00600v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a. Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

It leverages semantic map abstractions to unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations, as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline: learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful trajectories.</p></details> |  |

To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system. Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

This work mitigates these challenges by introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process. Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning, and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception, language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark, it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate, consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.</p></details> | technique report |
| **[AIRoA MoMa Dataset: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25032v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models.

| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[IA-VLA: Input Augmentation for Vision-Language-Action models in settings with semantically complex tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24768v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However, such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently, their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA, a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in the demonstrations.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent World Representations in OpenVLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24559v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.</p></details> |  |

To address this, integrating generalized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid, sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.</p></details> |  |

However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMMA: Generalizing Real-World Robot Manipulation via Generative Visual Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22407v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Actions as Language: Fine-Tuning VLMs into VLAs Without Catastrophic Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22195v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios, instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets. Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800 real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-aware Dynamic Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22093v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic. Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\% improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and performance frontier of robotic manipulation.

| **[Developing Vision-Language-Action Model from Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21986v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly, expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and (iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements. These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and scalable resource for advancing VLA research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLI: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01862v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting autonomous agents for real-world industrial, domestic, and other daily tasks is currently gaining momentum. However, in global or cross-lingual application contexts, ensuring effective interaction with the environment and executing unrestricted human-specified tasks regardless of the language remains an unsolved problem. To address this, we propose ReLI, a language-agnostic approach that enables autonomous agents to converse naturally, semantically reason about their environment, and perform downstream tasks, regardless of the task instruction's modality or linguistic origin. First, we ground large-scale pre-trained foundation models and transform them into language-to-action models that can directly provide common-sense reasoning and high-level robot control through natural, free-flow conversational interactions. Further, we perform cross-lingual adaptation of the models to ensure that ReLI generalises across the global languages. To demonstrate ReLI's robustness, we conducted extensive experiments on various short- and long-horizon tasks, including zero- and few-shot spatial navigation, scene information retrieval, and query-oriented tasks. We benchmarked the performance on $140$ languages involving $70K+$ multi-turn conversations. On average, ReLI achieved over $90\%\pm0.2$ accuracy in cross-lingual instruction parsing and task execution success. These results demonstrate its potential to advance natural human-agent interaction in the real world while championing inclusive and linguistic diversity. Demos and resources will be public at: https://linusnep.github.io/ReLI/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curiosity-Driven Co-Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05013v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 14 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

However, in real-world human-robot collaboration, following human spoken instructions can be challenging due to various speaker and environmental factors, such as background noise or mispronunciation. When faced with noisy auditory inputs, humans can leverage the collaborative context in the embodied environment to interpret noisy spoken instructions and take pragmatic assistive actions. In this paper, we present a cognitively inspired neurosymbolic model, Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), which leverages a Vision-Language Model with model-based mental inference to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions. We test SIFToM in both simulated environments (VirtualHome) and real-world human-robot collaborative settings with human evaluations. Results show that SIFToM can significantly improve the performance of a lightweight base VLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and approaching human-level accuracy on challenging spoken instruction following tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HeLoM: Hierarchical Learning for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation in Hexapod Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23651v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however, demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning. This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to designated goal poses in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods, while effective in this domain, may be prohibitively slow to converge when adapting to disturbances that require new task sequencing and optimisation. These events are common during tight-tolerance assembly, where difficult-to-model dynamics such as friction or deformation require rapid replanning and reattempts. Moreover, defining explicit task sequences for assembly can be cumbersome, limiting flexibility when task replanning is required. To simplify this planning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a piecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of adaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only myopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates effectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity of the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual assembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these experiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework generates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an emergent fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Studying avian behavior in the wild remains challenging due to the need for highly realistic morphology, durable outdoor operation, and intelligent perception that can adapt to uncontrolled environments. We present a next generation bio inspired robotic platform that replicates the morphology and visual appearance of the female Houbara bustard to support controlled ethological studies and conservation oriented field research. The system introduces a fully digitally replicable fabrication workflow that combines high resolution structured light 3D scanning, parametric CAD modelling, articulated 3D printing, and photorealistic UV textured vinyl finishing to achieve anatomically accurate and durable robotic surrogates. A six wheeled rocker bogie chassis ensures stable mobility on sand and irregular terrain, while an embedded NVIDIA Jetson module enables real time RGB and thermal perception, lightweight YOLO based detection, and an autonomous visual servoing loop that aligns the robot's head toward detected targets without human intervention. A lightweight thermal visible fusion module enhances perception in low light conditions. Field trials in desert aviaries demonstrated reliable real time operation at 15 to 22 FPS with latency under 100 ms and confirmed that the platform elicits natural recognition and interactive responses from live Houbara bustards under harsh outdoor conditions. This integrated framework advances biomimetic field robotics by uniting reproducible digital fabrication, embodied visual intelligence, and ecological validation, providing a transferable blueprint for animal robot interaction research, conservation robotics, and public engagement.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel velocity-form DeePC framework that achieves robust and optimal control of soft robots under unknown payloads. The proposed framework leverages input-output data in an incremental representation to mitigate performance degradation induced by unknown payloads, eliminating the need for weighted datasets or disturbance estimators. We validate the method experimentally on a planar soft robot and demonstrate its superior performance compared to standard DeePC in scenarios involving unknown payloads.</p></details> |  |

Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions, regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reliable and Scalable Robot Policy Evaluation with Imperfect Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04354v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Dual-model pipeline method and large multimodal model were compared, and the GPT-4o multimodal model was adopted in license plate recognition without preprocessing. For moving smoothly on a flat ground, the robot navigated in a simulated parking lot in the experiments. The robot changes angle view of the camera automatically to capture the images around with the format of license plate number. From the captured images of the robot, the numbers on the plate are recognized through the GPT-4o model, and identifies legality of the numbers. When an illegal parking is detected, the robot sends Line messages to the system manager immediately. The contribution of the work is that a novel multimodal deep learning method has validated with high accuracy in license plate recognition, and a social assistive robot is also provided for solving problems in a real scenario, and can be applied in an indoor parking lot.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of robotics to facilitate transcatheter procedures in the context of mitral valve edge-to-edge repair. The complex handle-based control of a clinical repair device is replaced by intuitive robotic joint-based control via a game controller. Manual versus robotic performance is analyzed by decomposing the overall device delivery task into motion-specific steps and comparing capabilities on a step-by-step basis in a phantom model of the heart and vasculature. Metrics include procedure duration and clip placement accuracy. Results demonstrate that the robotic system can reduce procedural time and motion errors while also improving accuracy of clip placement. These findings suggest that robotic assistance can address key limitations of manual systems, offering a more reliable and user-friendly platform for complex transcatheter procedures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[HEHA: Hierarchical Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Exploration of Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04161v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the path planning problem for autonomous exploration of an unknown environment using multiple heterogeneous robots such as drones, wheeled, and legged robots, which have different capabilities to traverse complex terrains. A key challenge there is to intelligently allocate the robots to the unknown areas to be explored and determine the visiting order of those spaces subject to traversablity constraints, which leads to a large scale constrained optimization problem that needs to be quickly and iteratively solved every time when new space are explored. To address the challenge, we propose HEHA (Hierarchical Exploration with Heterogeneous Agents) by leveraging a recent hierarchical method that decompose the exploration into global planning and local planning. The major contribution in HEHA is its global planning, where we propose a new routing algorithm PEAF (Partial Anytime Focal search) that can quickly find bounded sub-optimal solutions to minimize the maximum path length among the agents subject to traversability constraints. Additionally, the local planner in HEHA also considers heterogeneity to avoid repeated and duplicated exploration among the robots. The experimental results show that, our HEHA can reduce up to 30% of the exploration time than the baselines.</p></details> | 5 Figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners, achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAFFLE: A Wearable Approach to Bite Timing Estimation in Robot-Assisted Feeding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03910v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of people around the world need assistance with feeding. Robotic feeding systems offer the potential to enhance autonomy and quality of life for individuals with impairments and reduce caregiver workload. However, their widespread adoption has been limited by technical challenges such as estimating bite timing, the appropriate moment for the robot to transfer food to a user's mouth. In this work, we introduce WAFFLE: Wearable Approach For Feeding with LEarned bite timing, a system that accurately predicts bite timing by leveraging wearable sensor data to be highly reactive to natural user cues such as head movements, chewing, and talking. We train a supervised regression model on bite timing data from 14 participants and incorporate a user-adjustable assertiveness threshold to convert predictions into proceed or stop commands. In a study with 15 participants without motor impairments with the Obi feeding robot, WAFFLE performs statistically on par with or better than baseline methods across measures of feeling of control, robot understanding, and workload, and is preferred by the majority of participants for both individual and social dining. We further demonstrate WAFFLE's generalizability in a study with 2 participants with motor impairments in their home environments using a Kinova 7DOF robot. Our findings support WAFFLE's effectiveness in enabling natural, reactive bite timing that generalizes across users, robot hardware, robot positioning, feeding trajectories, foods, and both individual and social dining contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSwap: A GAN-driven Video Diffusion Framework For Unsupervised Robot Arm Swapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08632v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$ trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UccngwgPqUwPMhBja7JrXfZoTquCx_Qe/view?usp=sharing</p></details> |

This paper presents the first systematic study quantifying how visual degradations--including blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and Gaussian noise--affect robotic self-modeling. Through both simulation and physical experiments, we demonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and damage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration with morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues critical for self-modeling. In addition, we integrate semantic segmentation to robustly isolate robots from cluttered and colorful scenes. Extensive experiments show that our approach restores near-baseline performance across simulated and physical platforms, while existing pipelines degrade significantly. These contributions advance the robustness of visual self-modeling and establish practical foundations for deploying self-aware robots in unpredictable real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by soft-bodied inchworm, we present a fully untethered soft robot with a curved, flexible structure actuated by magnetic forces. The robot has a total mass of 102.63 g and demonstrates multimodal locomotion, achieving a maximum walking speed of 3.74 cm/s and a swimming speed of 0.82 cm/s. A compact and lightweight onboard control circuit enables wireless command transmission, while an integrated camera provides environmental perception. Through structural optimization and system-level integration, the robot successfully performs walking, steering, swimming, and payload transport without reliance on external infrastructure. The robot's dynamic performance and locomotion capabilities are systematically validated through experimental characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Act Through Contact: A Unified View of Multi-Task Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03599v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified framework for multi-task locomotion and manipulation policy learning grounded in a contact-explicit representation. Instead of designing different policies for different tasks, our approach unifies the definition of a task through a sequence of contact goals-desired contact positions, timings, and active end-effectors. This enables leveraging the shared structure across diverse contact-rich tasks, leading to a single policy that can perform a wide range of tasks. In particular, we train a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) policy to realise given contact plans. We validate our framework on multiple robotic embodiments and tasks: a quadruped performing multiple gaits, a humanoid performing multiple biped and quadrupedal gaits, and a humanoid executing different bimanual object manipulation tasks. Each of these scenarios is controlled by a single policy trained to execute different tasks grounded in contacts, demonstrating versatile and robust behaviours across morphologically distinct systems. Our results show that explicit contact reasoning significantly improves generalisation to unseen scenarios, positioning contact-explicit policy learning as a promising foundation for scalable loco-manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Space Graphs: Fast and Collision-Free Path Planning for Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03547v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots, inspired by elephant trunks or octopus arms, offer extraordinary flexibility to bend, twist, and elongate in ways that rigid robots cannot. However, their motion planning remains a challenge, especially in cluttered environments with obstacles, due to their highly nonlinear and infinite-dimensional kinematics. Here, we present a graph-based path planning tool for an elephant-trunk-inspired soft robotic arm designed with three artificial muscle fibers that allow for multimodal continuous deformation through contraction. Using a biomechanical model inspired by morphoelasticity and active filament theory, we precompute a shape library and construct a $k$-nearest neighbor graph in \emph{shape space}, ensuring that each node corresponds to a mechanically accurate and physically valid robot shape. For the graph, we use signed distance functions to prune nodes and edges colliding with obstacles, and define multi-objective edge costs based on geometric distance and actuation effort, enabling energy-efficient planning with collision avoidance. We demonstrate that our algorithm reliably avoids obstacles and generates feasible paths within milliseconds from precomputed graphs using Dijkstra's algorithm. We show that including energy costs can drastically reduce the actuation effort compared to geometry-only planning, at the expense of longer tip trajectories. Our results highlight the potential of shape-space graph search for fast and reliable path planning in the field of soft robotics, paving the way for real-time applications in surgical, industrial, and assistive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03532v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LapSurgie: Humanoid Robots Performing Surgery via Teleoperated Handheld Laparoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03529v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback. Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing planners that rely solely on kinodynamic models, we present a prediction-driven safe planning framework that leverages granular, joint-by-joint human motion forecasting validated in a physics-based digital twin. A capsule-based artificial potential field (APF) converts these granular predictions into collision risk metrics, triggering an Adaptive RRT* (A-RRT*) planner when thresholds are exceeded. The depth camera is used to extract 3D skeletal poses and a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model to predict individual joint trajectories ahead of time. A digital twin model integrates real-time human posture prediction placed in front of a simulated robot to evaluate motions and physical contacts. The proposed method enables validation of planned trajectories ahead of time and bridging potential latency gaps in updating planned trajectories in real-time. In 50 trials, our method achieved 100% proactive avoidance with > 250 mm clearance and sub-2 s replanning, demonstrating superior precision and reliability compared to existing kinematic-only planners through the integration of predictive human modeling with digital twin validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Destination-to-Chutes Task Mapping Optimization for Multi-Robot Coordination in Robotic Sorting Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03472v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study optimizing a destination-to-chutes task mapping to improve throughput in Robotic Sorting Systems (RSS), where a team of robots sort packages on a sortation floor by transporting them from induct workstations to eject chutes based on their shipping destinations (e.g. Los Angeles or Pittsburgh). The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which chutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is challenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing task mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning. Second, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient packages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality directly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same destination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally define task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We then present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings. We then present a simple TMO method based on the Evolutionary Algorithm and Mixed Integer Linear Programming, demonstrating the advantage of our optimized task mappings over the greedily generated ones in various RSS setups with different map sizes, numbers of chutes, and destinations. Finally, we use Quality Diversity algorithms to analyze the throughput of a diverse set of task mappings.

We present the first method that enables robots to autonomously invent symbolic, relational concepts directly from a small number of raw, unsegmented, and unannotated demonstrations. From these, the robot learns logic-based world models that support zero-shot generalization to tasks of far greater complexity than those in training. Our framework achieves performance on par with hand-engineered symbolic models, while scaling to execution horizons far beyond training and handling up to 18$\times$ more objects than seen during learning. The results demonstrate a framework for autonomously acquiring transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot experience, contributing toward the development of interpretable, scalable, and generalizable robot planning systems.

| **[Warm-Starting Optimization-Based Motion Planning for Robotic Manipulators via Point Cloud-Conditioned Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03460v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid robot motion generation is critical in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) systems, as robots need to respond to dynamic environments in real time by continuously observing their surroundings and replanning their motions to ensure both safe interactions and efficient task execution. Current sampling-based motion planners face challenges in scaling to high-dimensional configuration spaces and often require post-processing to interpolate and smooth the generated paths, resulting in time inefficiency in complex environments. Optimization-based planners, on the other hand, can incorporate multiple constraints and generate smooth trajectories directly, making them potentially more time-efficient. However, optimization-based planners are sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local minima. In this work, we present a novel learning-based method that utilizes a Flow Matching model conditioned on a single-view point cloud to learn near-optimal solutions for optimization initialization. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the environment, such as obstacle locations and geometries, and can generate feasible trajectories directly from single-view depth camera input. Simulation studies on a UR5e robotic manipulator in cluttered workspaces demonstrate that the proposed generative initializer achieves a high success rate on its own, significantly improves the success rate of trajectory optimization compared with traditional and learning-based benchmark initializers, requires fewer optimization iterations, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Stability Certificate for Robotics in Real-World Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03123v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data, enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic, real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has focused primarily on optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts. Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges, we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration, Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies, we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.</p></details> |  |

The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system, and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are experimentally validated.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, Accepted 27 July 2025, Available online 16 Sept 2025, Version of Record 28 Sept 2025</p></details> |

A Correlation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02941v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys, provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks consensus on a standard set of metrics. This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and new metrics are necessary.</p></details> |  |

The proposed algorithm integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the robotics community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IROS2025</p></details> |

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 15th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2025, see https://ipin-conference.org/2025/</p></details> |

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJRR.

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[Multi-robot Rigid Formation Navigation via Synchronous Motion and Discrete-time Communication-Control Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02624v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks, particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit, we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$ and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.</p></details> |  |

We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals (pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion, where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags, UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Our system allows users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot. Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25358v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework. The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects. Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured environments.

This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Constrained Robot Grasp Planning for Dynamic Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01399v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool use requires not only selecting appropriate tools but also generating grasps and motions that remain stable under dynamic interactions. Existing approaches largely focus on high-level tool grounding or quasi-static manipulation, overlooking stability in dynamic and cluttered regimes. We introduce iTuP (inverse Tool-use Planning), a framework that outputs robot grasps explicitly tailored for tool use. iTuP integrates a physics-constrained grasp generator with a task-conditional scoring function to produce grasps that remain stable during dynamic tool interactions. These grasps account for manipulation trajectories, torque requirements, and slip prevention, enabling reliable execution of real-world tasks. Experiments across hammering, sweeping, knocking, and reaching tasks demonstrate that iTuP outperforms geometry-based and vision-language model (VLM)-based baselines in grasp stability and task success. Our results underscore that physics-constrained grasping is essential for robust robot tool use in quasi-static, dynamic, and cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission and under review</p></details> |

| **[Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05038v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at https://github.com/IBM/test-time-hybrid-retrieval</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04991v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms, corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter paths on average.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Pragmatic Embodied Spoken Instruction Following in Human-Robot Collaboration with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10849v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken language instructions are ubiquitous in agent collaboration. However, in real-world human-robot collaboration, following human spoken instructions can be challenging due to various speaker and environmental factors, such as background noise or mispronunciation. When faced with noisy auditory inputs, humans can leverage the collaborative context in the embodied environment to interpret noisy spoken instructions and take pragmatic assistive actions. In this paper, we present a cognitively inspired neurosymbolic model, Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), which leverages a Vision-Language Model with model-based mental inference to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions. We test SIFToM in both simulated environments (VirtualHome) and real-world human-robot collaborative settings with human evaluations. Results show that SIFToM can significantly improve the performance of a lightweight base VLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and approaching human-level accuracy on challenging spoken instruction following tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Tale of Two Experts: Cooperative Learning for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22229v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that (1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2) separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3) enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main, 28 pages, 11 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12266v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

| **[ViTs: Teaching Machines to See Time Series Anomalies Like Human Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04710v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In particular, seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model outputs. While multimodal safety has received increasing attention, existing approaches often fail to address such latent risks, especially when harmfulness arises only from the interaction between modalities. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free, intent-aware safety framework that proactively detects harmful intent in multimodal inputs and uses it to guide the generation of safe responses. SIA follows a three-stage process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning; (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; and (3) intent-conditioned response generation. By dynamically adapting to the implicit intent inferred from an image-text pair, SIA mitigates harmful outputs without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments on safety benchmarks, including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, show that SIA consistently improves safety and outperforms prior training-free methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems(SafeMM-AI) Workshop at ICCV2025, Non-archival track</p></details> |

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are replaced by textual descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Representation Learning for Customized Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04564v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-NeurIPS-CRL.</p></details> |  |

Uncovering the Reasoning-Planning Disconnect in Training Vision-Language Driving Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04532v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan. Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately, indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel, training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the causal fidelity of future models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset will be released publicly once the paper is accepted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14715v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning.

However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

However, current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive, Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other VLM-based techniques.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRanker: Distance-Aware Ranking for Worldwide Image Geolocalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13731v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

An Urban Perception Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18857v4)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

We introduce AgentTypo, a black-box red-teaming framework that mounts adaptive typographic prompt injection by embedding optimized text into webpage images. Our automatic typographic prompt injection (ATPI) algorithm maximizes prompt reconstruction by substituting captioners while minimizing human detectability via a stealth loss, with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator guiding black-box optimization over text placement, size, and color. To further enhance attack strength, we develop AgentTypo-pro, a multi-LLM system that iteratively refines injection prompts using evaluation feedback and retrieves successful past examples for continual learning. Effective prompts are abstracted into generalizable strategies and stored in a strategy repository, enabling progressive knowledge accumulation and reuse in future attacks. Experiments on the VWA-Adv benchmark across Classifieds, Shopping, and Reddit scenarios show that AgentTypo significantly outperforms the latest image-based attacks such as AgentAttack. On GPT-4o agents, our image-only attack raises the success rate from 0.23 to 0.45, with consistent results across GPT-4V, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus. In image+text settings, AgentTypo achieves 0.68 ASR, also outperforming the latest baselines. Our findings reveal that AgentTypo poses a practical and potent threat to multimodal agents and highlight the urgent need for effective defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models (VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this, ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced training and inference times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huiwon-jang.github.io/contextvla</p></details> |
| **[From Gaze to Insight: Bridging Human Visual Attention and Vision Language Model Explanation for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11368v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision, clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices, we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2) Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions; (3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals, thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical AI systems.

Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in visual evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 images (19 pages, 11 figures including appendix)</p></details> |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness.

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning using meticulously annotated data. However, this approach may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, limiting the model's generalization ability under domain shifts and reducing real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for visual reasoning. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated CoT data activates the reasoning potential of VLMs. This is followed by reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which generates multiple reasoning-response pairs to enhance adaptability to domain shifts. To evaluate Reason-RFT, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset covering visual counting, structural perception, and spatial transformation, serving as a benchmark for systematic assessment across three key dimensions. Experimental results highlight three advantages: (1) performance enhancement, with Reason-RFT achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming both open-source and proprietary models; (2) generalization superiority, maintaining robust performance under domain shifts across various tasks; and (3) data efficiency, excelling in few-shot learning scenarios and surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines. Reason-RFT introduces a novel training paradigm for visual reasoning and marks a significant step forward in multimodal research.

Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results with larger dataset experiments and expanded discussion</p></details> |

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) remain challenged by compositional visual reasoning. This paper presents VLAgent, a neuro-symbolic approach to developing a Vision-Language Agent system for efficient compositional visual reasoning with three novel features. First, VLAgent develops an interpretable visualization-enhanced two-stage neuro-symbolic reasoning system. The first stage is managed by a front-end engine that generates a structured visual reasoning plan (symbolic program script) for each compositional visual reasoning task by utilizing a pre-trained LLM powered with few-shot chain-of-thought in-context learning. The second stage is managed by a high-performance back-end engine. It transforms the planning script into executable code based on visual input (image or video) and the combination of neural models and symbolic functions and then performs a sequence of actions for the compositional visual reason task. Second, to ensure and enhance the quality of mapping the logic plan to a sequence of executable instructions, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which examines the syntax and semantic correctness of the planning script, detects and repairs the logic errors found in the LLM-generated logic plan before generating the executable program. Third, VLAgent introduces the execution verifier in critical reasoning steps to validate and refine its compositional reasoning results in a stepwise manner, for example, ensemble methods for critical visual reasoning and caption analysis for low-confidence compositional reasoning. Extensive experiments on six visual benchmarks compared to a dozen SoTA visual reasoning models show that VLAgent outperforms existing representative approaches to compositional visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, their potential for zero-shot fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs' comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

| **[Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.</p></details> |  |

As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-72B achieves an average success rate of 45.0% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models. Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updata author list, modify first page format, correct typos</p></details> |

To identify this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM'25, MALLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Circle-RoPE: Cone-like Decoupled Rotary Positional Embedding for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16416v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when extended to vision-language models (VLMs), RoPE and its variants enforce relative positional dependencies separately within text and image tokens, introducing unintended cross-modal positional biases. For example, image tokens depicting semantically consistent content are assigned distinct positional encodings solely due to spatial location variations. As a result, such tokens exhibit entirely different relative positional relationships with their corresponding text tokens, ultimately leading to misaligned cross-modal representations. To address this, we propose Per-Token Distance, a simple yet effective metric for quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities. Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme designed to eliminate spurious cross-modal biases. Our key idea is to project image token indices onto a \emph{ring} that is orthogonal to the linear axis of text token indices, thereby forming a cone-like structure in the positional encoding space. In this configuration, each text token (point on the linear text axis) becomes the apex of a cone and maintains an equal distance to all image tokens (points on the circular image \emph{ring}), reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a staggered strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible positional encoding framework for VLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lose4578/CircleRoPE.</p></details> |  |

A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.</p></details> | 48 pages |

While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[MonitorVLM:A Vision Language Framework for Safety Violation Detection in Mining Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03666v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Security Threat of Compressed Projectors in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00534v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of a suitable visual language projector (VLP) is critical to the successful training of large visual language models (LVLMs). Mainstream VLPs can be broadly categorized into compressed and uncompressed projectors, and each offers distinct advantages in performance and computational efficiency. However, their security implications have not been thoroughly examined. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant differences in their security profiles: compressed projectors exhibit substantial vulnerabilities, allowing adversaries to successfully compromise LVLMs even with minimal knowledge of structure information. In stark contrast, uncompressed projectors demonstrate robust security properties and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities. These findings provide critical guidance for researchers in selecting optimal VLPs that enhance the security and reliability of visual language models.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.</p></details> | IEEE Submission |
| **[Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models for Image Quality Assessment via Voting and Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25787v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Cross-Modal Content Optimization for Steering Web Agent Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03612v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language model (VLM)-based web agents increasingly power high-stakes selection tasks like content recommendation or product ranking by combining multimodal perception with preference reasoning. Recent studies reveal that these agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes through preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image perturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong white-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical settings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint exploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful preference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce Cross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible modifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting CLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to steer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient access, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic black-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own listing's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model internals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary and open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both movie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is significantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our results show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models while maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness and stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as agentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameOracle: Learning What to See and How Much to See in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03584v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity, resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by 1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Small Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03574v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.</p></details> |  |

This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states, advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems.

| **[Code World Models for General Game Playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04542v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach -- involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions (to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability: The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules, allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10 considered games.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning remains a core challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LLMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. Conceptually, SymPlanner operationalizes two cognitive faculties: (i) error monitoring and repair via externalized feedback (IC) and (ii) preference formation among alternatives via pairwise comparison (CR), advancing cognitively plausible, symbol-grounded planning aligned with the rich structure in intelligent systems. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Twelfth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems</p></details> |

While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that generates 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces dynamic environments where objects can be directed, recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits to be applied interactively without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high scene fidelity while enabling controllability and editability. The code is available at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Morph4D.</p></details> |  |

The EGRT provides a means to identify good regulation, or the conditions under which an agent (regulator) can match the dynamical behavior of a system. We reevaluate and recast the EGRT in a modern context to provide insight into how intelligent autonomous learning systems might utilize a compressed global representation (world model). One-to-one mappings between a regulator (R) and the corresponding system (S) provide a reduced representation that preserves useful variety to match all possible outcomes of a system. The EGRT also extends to second-order cybernetics, where an internal model (M) observes the behavior of S and supervises a S-R closed loop mapping. Secondarily, we demonstrate how physical phenomena such as temporal criticality, non-normal denoising, and alternating procedural acquisition can recast behavior as statistical mechanics and yield regulatory relationships. These diverse physical systems challenge the notion of tightly-coupled good regulation when applied to non-uniform and out-of-distribution phenomena. Overall, we aim to recast the EGRT as a potential approach for developing world models that adapt and respond to a wide range of task environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 5 figures, 3 supplemental Figures, 3 supplemental tables</p></details> |

GDPval covers the majority of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Activities for 44 occupations across the top 9 sectors contributing to U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Tasks are constructed from the representative work of industry professionals with an average of 14 years of experience. We find that frontier model performance on GDPval is improving roughly linearly over time, and that the current best frontier models are approaching industry experts in deliverable quality. We analyze the potential for frontier models, when paired with human oversight, to perform GDPval tasks cheaper and faster than unaided experts. We also demonstrate that increased reasoning effort, increased task context, and increased scaffolding improves model performance on GDPval. Finally, we open-source a gold subset of 220 tasks and provide a public automated grading service at evals.openai.com to facilitate future research in understanding real-world model capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Perception to Cognition: A Survey of Vision-Language Interactive Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25373v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Multimodal Foundation Models and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03727v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information, control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive, editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

We present the first method that enables robots to autonomously invent symbolic, relational concepts directly from a small number of raw, unsegmented, and unannotated demonstrations. From these, the robot learns logic-based world models that support zero-shot generalization to tasks of far greater complexity than those in training. Our framework achieves performance on par with hand-engineered symbolic models, while scaling to execution horizons far beyond training and handling up to 18$\times$ more objects than seen during learning. The results demonstrate a framework for autonomously acquiring transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot experience, contributing toward the development of interpretable, scalable, and generalizable robot planning systems.

The proposed method combines the NSFD framework with a new non-local approximation of the right-hand side function. This method achieves second-order convergence and unconditionally preserves the positivity of solutions for all step sizes. Especially, it avoids the restrictive conditions required by many existing positivity-preserving, second-order NSFD methods. The method is easy to implement and computationally efficient. Numerical experiments, including an improved NSFD scheme for an SIR epidemic model, confirm the theoretical results. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's applicability to nonlinear partial differential equations and boundary value problems with positive solutions, showcasing its versatility in real-world modeling.</p></details> | 6 Tables, 3 Figures |

To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[STORI: A Benchmark and Taxonomy for Stochastic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01793v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have achieved impressive performance on simulated benchmarks such as Atari100k, yet recent advances remain largely confined to simulation and show limited transfer to real-world domains. A central obstacle is environmental stochasticity, as real systems involve noisy observations, unpredictable dynamics, and non-stationary conditions that undermine the stability of current methods. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these uncertainties and favor simplified settings where algorithms can be tuned to succeed. The absence of a well-defined taxonomy of stochasticity further complicates evaluation, as robustness to one type of stochastic perturbation, such as sticky actions, does not guarantee robustness to other forms of uncertainty. To address this critical gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that systematically incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous evaluation of RL techniques under different forms of uncertainty. We propose a comprehensive five-type taxonomy of environmental stochasticity and demonstrate systematic vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms through targeted evaluation of DreamerV3 and STORM. Our findings reveal that world models dramatically underestimate environmental variance, struggle with action corruption, and exhibit unreliable dynamics under partial observability. We release the code and benchmark publicly at https://github.com/ARY2260/stori, providing a unified framework for developing more robust RL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2.

| **[A Recipe for Efficient Sim-to-Real Transfer in Manipulation with Online Imitation-Pretrained World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02538v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over existing offline imitation learning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild-moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoundReactor: Frame-level Online Video-to-Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02110v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at https://koichi-saito-sony.github.io/soundreactor/.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention - MICCAI 2025, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 15968</p></details> |
| **[FideDiff: Efficient Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Image Motion Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01641v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/JiahaoPlus/EvoWorld</p></details> |

Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00855v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dyva-worldlm.github.io</p></details> |

In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically, TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench, especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.</p></details> |  |

Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To improve code understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024.

Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09346v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2308.12252</p></details> |

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

| **[Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios, consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively, defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment.

While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models, maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration, we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kunhao-liu.github.io/Rolling_Forcing_Webpage/</p></details> |
| **[The Physical Basis of Prediction: World Model Formation in Neural Organoids via an LLM-Generated Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04633v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[Hierarchical Task Environments as the Next Frontier for Embodied World Models in Robot Soccer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring the successes seen in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[DyMoDreamer: World Modeling with Dynamic Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24804v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\% performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark.

| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

| **[Emergent World Representations in OpenVLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24559v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Agents Inside of Scalable World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24527v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents. However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://danijar.com/dreamer4/</p></details> |

Existing approaches suffer from two key challenges: (1) they heavily rely on experiences obtained from human-created data or curricula, failing to autonomously update and select multimodal experiences, and (2) they may encounter catastrophic forgetting issues when faced with new tasks, failing to autonomously update world knowledge. To solve these challenges, this paper presents {\it EvoAgent}, a self-evolving agent with a continual World Model (WM), which can autonomously complete various LH tasks across environments through self-planning, self-control, and self-reflection, without human intervention. Our proposed EvoAgent contains three modules, i.e., i) the memory-driven planner which uses an LLM along with the WM and interaction memory, to convert LH tasks into executable sub-tasks; ii) the WM-guided action controller which leverages WM to generate low-level actions and incorporates a self-verification mechanism to update multimodal experiences; iii) the experience-inspired reflector which implements a two-stage curriculum learning algorithm to select experiences for task-adaptive WM updates. Moreover, we develop a continual World Model for EvoAgent, which can autonomously update the multimodal experience pool and world knowledge through closed-loop dynamics. We conducted extensive experiments on Minecraft and Atair, compared with existing methods, EvoAgent can achieve an average success rate improvement of 105% and reduce ineffective actions by more than 6x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.</p></details> |  |

We further optimize the code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from 20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design, ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that supports future extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,15 figures, Accepted to the 5th Wordplay: When Language Meets Games Workshop, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
