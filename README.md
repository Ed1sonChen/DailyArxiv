| **[LatentVLA: Efficient Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving via Latent Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05611v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency. LatentVLA establishes a new state-of-the-art on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zeroshot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[GR-Dexter Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24210v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CombatVLA: An Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model for Combat Tasks in 3D Action Role-Playing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09527v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have expanded the capabilities of embodied intelligence. However, significant challenges remain in real-time decision-making in complex 3D environments, which demand second-level responses, high-resolution perception, and tactical reasoning under dynamic conditions. To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an efficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing games(ARPGs). Specifically, our CombatVLA is a 3B model trained on video-action pairs collected by an action tracker, where the data is formatted as action-of-thought (AoT) sequences. Thereafter, CombatVLA seamlessly integrates into an action execution framework, allowing efficient inference through our truncated AoT strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CombatVLA not only outperforms all existing models on the combat understanding benchmark but also achieves a 50-fold acceleration in game combat. Moreover, it has a higher task success rate than human players. We will open-source all resources, including the action tracker, dataset, benchmark, model weights, training code, and the implementation of the framework at https://combatvla.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

| **[RoboVIP: Multi-View Video Generation with Visual Identity Prompting Augments Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05241v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[$π_0$: A Vision-Language-Action Flow Model for General Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24164v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning holds tremendous promise to unlock the full potential of flexible, general, and dexterous robot systems, as well as to address some of the deepest questions in artificial intelligence. However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>See p...</summary><p>See project website for videos: https://physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0 Published in RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CLAP: Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining for Learning Vision-Language-Action Models from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04061v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist Vision-Language-Action models are currently hindered by the scarcity of robotic data compared to the abundance of human video demonstrations. Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

| **[Stable Language Guidance for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04052v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[I2E: From Image Pixels to Actionable Interactive Environments for Text-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03741v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alpamayo-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Action Prediction for Generalizable Autonomous Driving in the Long Tail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00088v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and causal understanding is limited. We introduce Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning for complex driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture combining Cosmos-Reason, a vision-language model pre-trained for Physical AI, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates dynamically feasible trajectories in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to enforce reasoning-action consistency and optimize reasoning quality. AR1 achieves up to a 12% improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training improves reasoning quality by 45% and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Alpamayo-R1-10B with inference code at https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Backdoor: Towards Stealthy Real-world Poisoning Attack on Vision-Language-Action Model in State Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04266v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely deployed in safety-critical embodied AI applications such as robotics. However, their complex multimodal interactions also expose new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we investigate a backdoor threat in VLA models, where malicious inputs cause targeted misbehavior while preserving performance on clean data. Existing backdoor methods predominantly rely on inserting visible triggers into visual modality, which suffer from poor robustness and low insusceptibility in real-world settings due to environmental variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the State Backdoor, a novel and practical backdoor attack that leverages the robot arm's initial state as the trigger. To optimize trigger for insusceptibility and effectiveness, we design a Preference-guided Genetic Algorithm (PGA) that efficiently searches the state space for minimal yet potent triggers. Extensive experiments on five representative VLA models and five real-world tasks show that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate without affecting benign task performance, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language-Action Model with Visual Prompt for OFF-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03519v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trajectory planning in off-road terrains presents a formidable challenge for autonomous vehicles, often necessitating complex multi-step pipelines. However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited Linguistic Diversity in Embodied AI Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03136v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOP: A Scalable Online Post-Training System for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03044v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization through large-scale pre-training, but real-world deployment requires expert-level task proficiency in addition to broad generality. Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboMIND 2.0: A Multimodal, Bimanual Mobile Manipulation Dataset for Generalizable Embodied Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24653v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVLA-A1: Unifying Understanding, Generation and Action for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02456v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and demonstrate exceptional proficiency in semantic understanding, but they inherently lack the capability to deduce physical world dynamics. Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\%-73.3\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CycleVLA: Proactive Self-Correcting Vision-Language-Action Models via Subtask Backtracking and Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02295v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current work on robot failure detection and correction typically operate in a post hoc manner, analyzing errors and applying corrections only after failures occur. This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

| **[SurgWorld: Learning Surgical Robot Policies from Videos via World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23162v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-Sketcher: From Reasoning to Action via Visual Sketches for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01618v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation is increasingly important for real-world deployment, requiring spatial disambiguation in complex layouts and temporal resilience under dynamic interaction. However, existing end-to-end and hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies often rely on text-only cues while keeping plan intent latent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered or underspecified scenes, impedes effective task decomposition of long-horizon goals with close-loop interaction, and limits causal explanation by obscuring the rationale behind action choices. To address these issues, we first introduce Visual Sketch, an implausible visual intermediate that renders points, boxes, arrows, and typed relations in the robot's current views to externalize spatial intent, connect language to scene geometry. Building on Visual Sketch, we present Action-Sketcher, a VLA framework that operates in a cyclic See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow coordinated by adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance, thereby supporting reactive corrections and human interaction while preserving real-time action prediction. To enable scalable training and evaluation, we curate diverse corpus with interleaved images, text, Visual Sketch supervision, and action sequences, and train Action-Sketcher with a multi-stage curriculum recipe that combines interleaved sequence alignment for modality unification, language-to-sketch consistency for precise linguistic grounding, and imitation learning augmented with sketch-to-action reinforcement for robustness. Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes and multi-object tasks, in simulation and on real-world tasks, show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans.

| **[Vision-Language-Action Models for Autonomous Driving: Past, Present, and Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16760v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey; 47 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables; GitHub Repo at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-vla-for-ad</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1.

| **[Value Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00969v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic manipulation, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on behavior cloning, leading to brittleness under distribution shift. While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Unified Embodied VLM Reasoning with Robotic Action via Autoregressive Discretized Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24125v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

| **[Dichotomous Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00898v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[VLA-RAIL: A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker for VLA Models and Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24673v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual VLA: Self-Reflective Vision-Language-Action Model with Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24426v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTTER: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Text-Aware Visual Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03734v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on visual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

| **[Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23864v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clutter-Resistant Vision-Language-Action Models through Object-Centric and Geometry Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22519v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance. To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects. On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Emergence of Human to Robot Transfer in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22414v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models can enable broad open world generalization, but require large and diverse datasets. It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.</p></details> |  |

We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |

This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026, the Project website is available at https://qhemu.github.io/CCoL/</p></details> |
| **[Asynchronous Fast-Slow Vision-Language-Action Policies for Whole-Body Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20188v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.</p></details> |  |

However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20014v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.</p></details> |  |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

To this end, we present a first-of-its-kind study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations and natural language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We establish a confidence baseline for VLAs, examine how task success relates to calibration error and how calibration evolves over time, and introduce two lightweight techniques to remedy the miscalibration we observe: prompt ensembles and action-wise Platt scaling. Our aim in this study is to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 19 figures; additional experiments with VLA variants</p></details> |

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.</p></details> |  |

| **[iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09072v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots deployed in the wild often encounter objects and scenes that break pre-trained perception models, yet adapting these models typically requires slow offline data collection, labeling, and retraining. We introduce iTeach, a human-in-the-loop system that enables robots to improve perception continuously as they explore new environments. A human sees the robot's predictions from its own viewpoint, corrects failures in real time, and the informed data drives iterative fine-tuning until performance is satisfactory. A mixed reality headset provides the interface, overlaying predictions in the user's view and enabling lightweight annotation via eye gaze and voice. Instead of tedious frame-by-frame labeling, a human guides the robot to scenes of choice and records short videos while interacting with objects. The human labels only the final frame, and a video segmentation model propagates labels across the sequence, converting seconds of input into dense supervision. The refined model is deployed immediately, closing the loop between human feedback and robot learning. We demonstrate iTeach on Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), achieving consistent improvements over a pre-trained MSMFormer baseline on both our collected dataset and the SceneReplica benchmark, where it leads to higher grasping success, followed by a real-world demonstration of grasping unseen objects with a Fetch robot. By combining human judgment, efficient annotation, and on-the-fly refinement, iTeach provides a practical path toward perception systems that generalize robustly in diverse real-world conditions.

| **[Motion Compensation for Real Time Ultrasound Scanning in Robotically Assisted Prostate Biopsy Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05661v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Its diagnosis by biopsy requires a high level of expertise and precision from the surgeon, so the results are highly operator-dependent. The aim of this work is to develop a robotic system for assisted ultrasound (US) examination of the prostate, a prebiopsy step that could reduce the dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate and more available prostate biopsy. We developed and validated a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that can autonomously scan a prostate phantom and attached the phantom to a medical robotic arm that mimics the patient's movements. The scanning robot keeps the relative position of the US probe and the prostate constant, ensuring a consistent and robust approach to reconstructing the prostate. To reconstruct the prostate, each slice is segmented to generate a series of prostate contours converted into a 3D point cloud used for biopsy planning. The average scan time of the prostate was 30 s, and the average 3D reconstruction of the prostate took 3 s. We performed four motion scenarios: the phantom was scanned in a stationary state (S), with horizontal motion (H), with vertical motion (V), and with a combination of the two (C). System validation is performed by registering the prostate point cloud reconstructions acquired during different motions (H, V, C) with those obtained in the stationary state. ICP registration with a threshold of 0.8 mm yields mean 83.2\% fitness and 0.35 mm RMSE for S-H registration, 84.1\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-V registration and 79.4\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-C registration. Due to the elastic and soft material properties of the prostate phantom, the maximum robot tracking error was 3 mm, which can be sufficient for prostate biopsy according to medical literature. The maximum delay in motion compensation was 0.5 s.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mobile Robot Localization Using a Novel Whisker-Like Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05612v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whisker-like touch sensors offer unique advantages for short-range perception in environments where visual and long-range sensing are unreliable, such as confined, cluttered, or low-visibility settings. This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multi-modal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC above 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failures remained undetected.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Steerability Factors for Growing Vine Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22504v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip, enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body. Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward and horizontal curvatures.</p></details> |  |

Upcoming decades focus on building a lunar outpost, with robotic systems playing a crucial role to safely and efficiently establish essential infrastructure such as solar power generating towers. Similar to the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), shipping necessary components via modules and assembling them in situ should be a practical scenario. In this context, this paper focuses on the integration of vision, control, and hardware systems within an autonomous sequence for a dual-arm robot system. We explore a perception and control pipeline specifically designed for assembling solar panel modules, one of the benchmark tasks. Ad hoc hardware was designed and tested in real-world experiments. A mock-up of modular solar panels and active-passive connectors are employed, with the control of this grappling fixture integrated into the proposed pipeline.

Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals. In this work, we present GAMMA (Gaze Assisted Manipulation for Modular Autonomy), a system that leverages ego-centric gaze tracking and a vision-language model to infer user intent and autonomously execute robotic manipulation tasks. By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.</p></details> |  |

However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>See p...</summary><p>See project website for videos: https://physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0 Published in RSS 2025</p></details> |

Offline Model-based RL (MBRL) offers greater data efficiency by training policies entirely from existing datasets, but suffers from compounding errors and distribution shift in long-horizon rollouts. Although existing methods have shown success in controlled simulation benchmarks, robustly applying them to the noisy, biased, and partially observed datasets typical of real-world robotics remains challenging. We present a principled pipeline for making offline MBRL effective on physical robots. Our RWM-U extends autoregressive world models with epistemic uncertainty estimation, enabling temporally consistent multi-step rollouts with uncertainty effectively propagated over long horizons. We combine RWM-U with MOPO-PPO, which adapts uncertainty-penalized policy optimization to the stable, on-policy PPO framework for real-world control. We evaluate our approach on diverse manipulation and locomotion tasks in simulation and on real quadruped and humanoid, training policies entirely from offline datasets. The resulting policies consistently outperform model-free and uncertainty-unaware model-based baselines, and fusing real-world data in model learning further yields robust policies that surpass online model-free baselines trained solely in simulation.</p></details> |  |

Roller skating, as a sport with substantial biomechanical value, can achieve fast and continuous sliding through rational utilization of body inertia, featuring minimal kinetic energy loss. Therefore, this study proposes a novel humanoid robot with each foot equipped with a row of four passive wheels for roller skating. A deep reinforcement learning control framework is also developed for the swizzle gait with the reward function design based on the intrinsic characteristics of roller skating. The learned policy is first analyzed in simulation and then deployed on the physical robot to demonstrate the smoothness and efficiency of the swizzle gait over traditional bipedal walking gait in terms of Impact Intensity and Cost of Transport during locomotion. A reduction of $75.86\%$ and $63.34\%$ of these two metrics indicate roller skating as a superior locomotion mode for enhanced energy efficiency and joint longevity.</p></details> |  |

The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for Journal publication in Frontiers in Robotics and AI</p></details> |

In real-world robotics, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) RoboReward, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a negative examples data augmentation pipeline that generates calibrated negative and near-misses via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we build a large training and evaluation dataset spanning diverse tasks and embodiments to test whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robot learning. Our evaluation of open and proprietary VLMs finds that no model excels across tasks, highlighting substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B model in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 while narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.

| **[Feel the Presence: The Effects of Haptic Sensation on VR-Based Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04596v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual reality (VR) has been increasingly utilised as a simulation tool for human-robot interaction (HRI) studies due to its ability to facilitate fast and flexible prototyping. Despite efforts to achieve high validity in VR studies, haptic sensation, an essential sensory modality for perception and a critical factor in enhancing VR realism, is often absent from these experiments. Studying an interactive robot help-seeking scenario, we used a VR simulation with haptic gloves that provide highly realistic tactile and force feedback to examine the effects of haptic sensation on VR-based HRI. We compared participants' sense of presence and their assessments of the robot to a traditional setup using hand controllers. Our results indicate that haptic sensation enhanced participants' social and self-presence in VR and fostered more diverse and natural bodily engagement. Additionally, haptic sensations significantly influenced participants' affective-related perceptions of the robot. Our study provides insights to guide HRI researchers in building VR-based simulations that better align with their study contexts and objectives.</p></details> |  |

These modular components are intended primarily for robotic systems in space exploration and construction on the Moon in our Moonshot project. Such modular robots add flexibility and versatility for space missions where resources are constrained. Each module is driven by a common actuator characterized by a high torque-to-speed ratio, supporting both precise control and dynamic motion when required. This unified actuator design simplifies development and maintenance across the different module types. The paper describes the hardware implementation, the mechanical design of the modules, and the overall software architecture used to control and coordinate them. Additionally, we evaluate the control performance of the actuator under various load conditions to characterize its suitability for modular robot applications. To demonstrate the adaptability of the system, we introduce nine functional configurations assembled from the same set of modules: 4DOF-limb, 8DOF-limb, vehicle, dragon, minimal, quadruped, cargo, cargo-minimal, and bike. These configurations reflect different locomotion strategies and task-specific behaviors, offering a practical foundation for further research in reconfigurable robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author's version of a manuscript accepted at the International Conference on Space Robotics 2025 (iSpaRo 2025).

We introduce a general framework that incorporates uncertainty models for actuation (e.g., tendon tensions), applied forces and moments, process noise, boundary conditions, and arbitrary backbone measurements. By adding temporal priors across time steps, our method additionally performs joint estimation in both the spatial (arclength) and temporal domains, enabling full \textit{spacetime} state estimation. Discretizing the arclength domain yields a factor graph representation of the continuum robot model, which can be exploited for fast batch sparse nonlinear optimization in the style of SLAM. The framework is general and applies to a broad class of continuum robots; as illustrative cases, we show (i) tendon-driven robots in simulation, where we demonstrate real-time kinematics with uncertainty, tip force sensing from position feedback, and distributed load estimation from backbone strain, and (ii) a surgical concentric tube robot in experiment, where we validate accurate kinematics and tip force estimation, highlighting potential for surgical palpation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Public preprint for ICRA 2026</p></details> |

We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2509.25575</p></details> |

Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an open-access, author-archived version of a manuscript published in European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning in Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19486v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control. While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human-robot shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost. Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a hash-distributed multi-goal A* search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300 km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These results show that when round-trip latency remains within the tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck, enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety, while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Error...</summary><p>Error in the graph size calculation, recalculated and resubmitted</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Sample Inheritance into Bayesian Optimization for Evolutionary Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03813v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In evolutionary robotics, robot morphologies are designed automatically using evolutionary algorithms. This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generational Replacement and Learning for High-Performing and Diverse Populations in Evolvable Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03807v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary Robotics offers the possibility to design robots to solve a specific task automatically by optimizing their morphology and control together. However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PointWorld: Scaling 3D World Models for In-The-Wild Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03782v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

| **[Tackling the Kidnapped Robot Problem via Sparse Feasible Hypothesis Sampling and Reliable Batched Multi-Stage Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01219v4)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the Kidnapped Robot Problem (KRP), a core localization challenge of relocalizing a robot in a known map without prior pose estimate when localization loss or at SLAM initialization. For this purpose, a passive 2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose efficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map while the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of mobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a non-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched multi-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and efficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability constraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse, uniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing the sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed Scan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that facilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates. The SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. The Translation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for reliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final pose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field metrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well as non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments on a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scans show that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance in both global relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Dual-Attention Heterogeneous GNN for Multi-robot Collaborative Area Search via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03686v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot collaborative area search, a key challenge is to dynamically balance the two objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific targets to be rescued. Existing methods are often constrained by homogeneous graph representations, thus failing to model and balance these distinct tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our method constructs a heterogeneous graph that incorporates three entity types: robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes, as well as their historical states. The dual-attention mechanism comprises the relational-aware attention and type-aware attention operations. The relational-aware attention captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among robots and candidate goals. Building on this relational-aware heterogeneous graph, the type-aware attention separately computes the relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs. points of interest), thereby decoupling the exploration and coverage from the unified tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive 3D scenarios within the iGibson simulator, leveraging the Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets, validate the superior scalability and generalization capability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Score to Sound: An End-to-End MIDI-to-Motion Pipeline for Robotic Cello Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03562v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot musicians require precise control to obtain proper note accuracy, sound quality, and musical expression. Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way. We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view, possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four field-of-view indicators in augmented reality and conducted a human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in a collaborative assembly task regarding accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum of positions: two at robot's eye and head space -- deepening eye socket and adding blocks to two sides of the eyes (i.e., egocentric), and two anchoring in the robot's task space -- adding extended blocks from the sides of eyes to the table and placing blocks directly on the tables (i.e., allocentric). Results showed that, when placed directly in the task space, the allocentric indicator yields the highest accuracy, although with a delay in interpreting the robot's field of view. When placed at the robot's eyes, the egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our augmented reality indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often suffer from slow reconstruction, limited visual fidelity, and difficulties in converting photorealistic models into planning-ready collision geometry. We present a practical framework that constructs high-quality digital twins within minutes from sparse RGB inputs. Our system employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for fast, photorealistic reconstruction as a unified scene representation. We enhance 3DGS with visibility-aware semantic fusion for accurate 3D labelling and introduce an efficient, filter-based geometry conversion method to produce collision-ready models seamlessly integrated with a Unity-ROS2-MoveIt physics engine. In experiments with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that this enhanced geometric accuracy effectively supports robust manipulation in real-world trials. These results demonstrate that 3DGS-based digital twins, enriched with semantic and geometric consistency, offer a fast, reliable, and scalable path from perception to manipulation in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review of Journal of Robot Learning</p></details> |

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods. We propose a two-layer validation framework that combines abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification. At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this article studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A key scientific problem addressed is the feasibility of applying first-order gradient-based optimization to complex differentiable granular material simulation and overcoming associated numerical instability. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil. Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimization for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent. Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimize digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a regular paper by the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo, OpenVLA and Pi Zero. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

| **[Steering Flexible Linear Objects in Planar Environments by Two Robot Hands Using Euler's Elastica Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02874v4)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manipulation of flexible objects such as cables, wires and fresh food items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents, called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and demonstrated with detailed examples.</p></details> |  |

We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking. Compared with the original Depth Anything model, our method improves $δ_{1}$ depth accuracy by 39.2% and reduces the navigation J-index by 0.67 relative to the second-best method, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Assistive Robotics: Multi-Modal Navigation and Biophysical Monitoring for Next-Generation Wheelchairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02766v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assistive electric-powered wheelchairs (EPWs) have become essential mobility aids for people with disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), post-stroke hemiplegia, and dementia-related mobility impairment. This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability. Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

| **[Learning to Nudge: A Scalable Barrier Function Framework for Safe Robot Interaction in Dense Clutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02686v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in everyday environments must navigate and manipulate within densely cluttered spaces, where physical contact with surrounding objects is unavoidable. Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\%-73.3\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |

As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing robotic face driving research primarily focuses on conversations or mimicking static expressions, struggling to meet the high demands for continuous emotional expression and coherence in singing. To address this, we propose a novel avatar-driven framework for appealing robotic singing. We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Based Early Fault Diagnosis and Self-Recovery for Strawberry Harvesting Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02085v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.</p></details> |  |

| **[Co-Training Vision Language Models for Remote Sensing Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21272v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05991v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

| **[Context-Aware Decoding for Faithful Vision-Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05939v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 Industry Track, 12 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

| **[Multimodal Interpretation of Remote Sensing Images: Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy and Multi-scale Vision-Language Alignment Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23243v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOVABench: A Vehicle Surveillance Action Retrieval Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04824v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic identification of events and recurrent behavior analysis are critical for video surveillance. However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models. Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at Real World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges, 6th (in WACV Workshops)</p></details> |

However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[See or Say Graphs: Agent-Driven Scalable Graph Structure Understanding with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16769v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph structure understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph structure understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that decomposes and routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for direct access to explicit graph properties and the visual modality for local graph structure reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to 200$\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to 4.4$\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatentVLA: Efficient Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving via Latent Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05611v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency. LatentVLA establishes a new state-of-the-art on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zeroshot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoV: Chain-of-View Prompting for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05172v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached. We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51% average improvement, peaking at +3.73% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.</p></details> |  |

Zeroth-Order Optimization for Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12409v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Continual Learning (VLCL) has attracted significant research attention for its robust capabilities, and the adoption of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies is enabling these models to achieve competitive performance with substantially reduced resource consumption. However, dominated First-Order (FO) optimization is prone to trap models in suboptimal local minima, especially in limited exploration subspace within PEFT. To overcome this challenge, this paper pioneers a systematic exploration of adopting Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for PEFT-based VLCL. We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO adoption in VLCL due to optimization process instability. We then investigate the application of ZO optimization from a modality branch-wise to a fine-grained layer-wise across various training units to identify an optimal strategy. Besides, a key theoretical insight reveals that vision modality exhibit higher variance than language counterparts in VLCL during the ZO optimization process, and we propose a modality-aware ZO strategy, which adopts gradient sign normalization in ZO and constrains vision modality perturbation to further improve performance. Benefiting from the adoption of ZO optimization, PEFT-based VLCL fulfills better ability to escape local minima during the optimization process, extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[e5-omni: Explicit Cross-modal Alignment for Omni-modal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03666v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B</p></details> |
| **[Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21329v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.</p></details> |  |

Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals. In this work, we present GAMMA (Gaze Assisted Manipulation for Modular Autonomy), a system that leverages ego-centric gaze tracking and a vision-language model to infer user intent and autonomously execute robotic manipulation tasks. By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.</p></details> |  |

We study a geometry-first discovery-and-interpretation setting under domain shift, where candidate regions are delineated class-agnostically and supervision avoids lexical class names via anonymized identifiers. Complementary to open-set recognition and open-world learning, we focus on coupling class-agnostic mask evidence with taxonomy-grounded scene interpretation, rather than unknown rejection or continual class expansion. We propose MVT, a three-stage framework that (i) extracts boundary-faithful region masks using SAM2 with domain adaptation, (ii) performs mask-grounded semantic tagging and scene description generation via dual-step LoRA fine-tuning of multimodal LLMs, and (iii) evaluates outputs with LLM-as-judge scoring calibrated by stratified expert ratings. On cross-dataset segmentation transfer (train on OpenEarthMap, evaluate on LoveDA), domain-adapted SAM2 improves mask quality; meanwhile, dual-step MLLM fine-tuning yields more accurate taxonomy-aligned tags and more informative mask-grounded scene descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at https://charlescsyyy.github.io/MVT</p></details> |

To tackle this challenge, we present FALCONEye, a novel video agent based on a training-free, model-agnostic meta-architecture composed of a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM). FALCONEye answers open-ended questions using an exploration-based search algorithm guided by calibrated confidence from the VLM's answers. We also introduce the FALCON-Bench benchmark, extending Question Answering problem to Video Answer Search-requiring models to return both the answer and its supporting temporal window for open-ended questions in hour-long videos. With just a 7B VLM and a lightweight LLM, FALCONEye outscores all open-source 7B VLMs and comparable agents in FALCON-Bench. It further demonstrates its generalization capability in MLVU benchmark with shorter videos and different tasks, surpassing GPT-4o on single-detail tasks while slashing inference cost by roughly an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

Clustering-Guided Insights for Training Data Enhancement in Visually-Rich Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05125v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces VERSE, a methodology for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding by exploring their visual embedding space. VERSE enables the visualization of latent representations, supporting the assessment of model feasibility. It also facilitates the identification of problematic regions and guides the generation of synthetic data to enhance performance in those clusters. We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret. Results show that VERSE helps uncover the visual features associated with error-prone clusters, and that retraining with samples containing these features substantially boosts F1 performance without degrading generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on-premise models such as Donut and Idefics2, when optimized with VERSE, match or even surpass the performance of SaaS solutions like GPT-4 and Pixtral.</p></details> |  |

However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>See p...</summary><p>See project website for videos: https://physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0 Published in RSS 2025</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we introduce PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual benchmark for chart question answering, comprising 22,606 charts and 26,151 QA pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is constructed through a scalable pipeline that enables efficient multilingual chart generation via data translation and code reuse, supported by LLM-based translation and rigorous quality control. We systematically evaluate multilingual chart understanding with PolyChartQA on state-of-the-art LVLMs and reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, particularly low-resource ones. Additionally, we introduce a companion multilingual chart question answering training set, PolyChartQA-Train, on which fine-tuning LVLMs yields substantial gains in multilingual chart understanding across diverse model sizes and architectures. Together, our benchmark provides a foundation for developing globally inclusive vision-language models capable of understanding charts across diverse linguistic contexts.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Instruction Tuning with and without Context: Behavioral Shifts and Downstream Impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15480v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning is a widely used approach to improve the instruction-following ability of large language models (LLMs). Instruction-tuning datasets typically include a mixture of context-augmented and context-free examples, yet prior work has largely combined these data types without examining their distinct effects. In this paper, we investigate how training LLMs with or without context affects model behavior and downstream performance. First, in the text domain, we show that LLMs trained with context attend more strongly to the provided knowledge, achieving better grounding. We also observe that context-augmented training shifts how LLMs use knowledge: models store and leverage less on parametric knowledge and instead depend more on the provided context. Second, we observe that using LLM trained with context-augmented data as the backbone for vision-language models reduces hallucination and improves grounding in the visual domain. Finally, we explore practical strategies for real-world deployments where context availability varies. We show that maintaining separate context-augmented and context-free models and routing inputs between them yields more robust overall performance than training a single mixed model, as it better preserves their complementary strengths.</p></details> |  |

Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars). Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contributed original research to top tier conference in VLM; currently undergoing peer review</p></details> |

In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new "A+B" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Industry Track of Top Tier Conference; currently under peer review</p></details> |

While recent methods have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate commonsense reasoning and improve exploration efficiency, their planning remains constrained by textual representations, which cannot adequately capture spatial occupancy or scene geometry--critical factors for navigation decisions. We explore whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can achieve mapless visual navigation using only onboard RGB/RGB-D streams, unlocking their potential for spatial perception and planning. We achieve this through an imagination-powered navigation framework, ImagineNav++, which imagines future observation images from candidate robot views and translates navigation planning into a simple best-view image selection problem for VLMs. First, a future-view imagination module distills human navigation preferences to generate semantically meaningful viewpoints with high exploration potential. These imagined views then serve as visual prompts for the VLM to identify the most informative viewpoint. To maintain spatial consistency, we develop a selective foveation memory mechanism, which hierarchically integrates keyframe observations via a sparse-to-dense framework, constructing a compact yet comprehensive memory for long-term spatial reasoning. This approach transforms goal-oriented navigation into a series of tractable point-goal navigation tasks. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object and instance navigation benchmarks show that ImagineNav++ achieves SOTA performance in mapless settings, even surpassing most map-based methods, highlighting the importance of scene imagination and memory in VLM-based spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.09874</p></details> |

Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.</p></details> |  |

We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</p></details> | EACL |

Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing.

In real-world robotics, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) RoboReward, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a negative examples data augmentation pipeline that generates calibrated negative and near-misses via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we build a large training and evaluation dataset spanning diverse tasks and embodiments to test whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robot learning. Our evaluation of open and proprietary VLMs finds that no model excels across tasks, highlighting substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B model in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 while narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards. We release the full dataset, trained reward models, and evaluation suite on our website to advance the development of general-purpose reward models in robotics: https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/robo-reward-bench (project website).</p></details> |  |

While reasoning improves model robustness, existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and rarely address the open-ended, diverse nature of agricultural queries. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Agri-R1}, a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture. Our framework automates high-quality reasoning data generation via vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering, using only 19\% of available samples. Training employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel proposed reward function that integrates domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching to assess both correctness and linguistic flexibility in open-ended responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, our resulting 3B-parameter model achieves performance competitive with 7B- to 13B-parameter baselines, showing a +23.2\% relative gain in disease recognition accuracy, +33.3\% in agricultural knowledge QA, and a +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization over standard fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins these gains, with benefits scaling as question complexity increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted for review to ACL 2026.

| **[GeoReason: Aligning Thinking And Answering In Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models Via Logical Consistency Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04118v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy, which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/MoIIE.</p></details> |  |

In current systems, however, description specificity is often conflated with their length. We argue that these two concepts must be disentangled: descriptions can be concise yet dense with information, or lengthy yet vacuous. We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference. These results support evaluation approaches that directly prioritize specificity over verbosity.</p></details> |  |

Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.</p></details> |  |

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 Pa...</summary><p>36 Pages, 13 Figures, 17 Tables (Meta data updated)</p></details> |

Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

To tackle it, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, aiming to adapt a source-pretrained model to both common and novel classes in a new domain with only few-shot annotations. We propose a unified framework that learns stable target semantics under limited supervision by bridging 2D open-set semantics with 3D spatial reasoning. Specifically, an image-guided multi-modal fusion injects transferable 2D semantic cues into the 3D pipeline via vision-language models, while a physically-aware box search enhances 2D-to-3D alignment via LiDAR priors. To capture class-specific semantics from sparse data, we further introduce contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which encodes few-shot instances into discriminative semantic anchors and stabilizes representation learning. Extensive experiments on GCFS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach in realistic deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The latest version refines the few-shot setting on common classes, enforcing a stricter object-level definition</p></details> |

Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

| **[Addressing Overthinking in Large Vision-Language Models via Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04442v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought mechanisms that generate step-by-step rationales. However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.</p></details> |  |

Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-DRF: Differentiable Reward Flow for Video Diffusion Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04153v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%. Our code and dataset will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjunlp/predict-before-execute.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and interactive demos at https://goal-force.github.io/</p></details> |

However, human drivers exhibit bounded rationality, making approximately optimal decisions under cognitive and perceptual constraints. We propose EvoQRE, a principled framework for modeling safety-critical traffic interactions as general-sum Markov games solved via Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and evolutionary game dynamics. EvoQRE integrates a pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, capturing stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure. We provide rigorous theoretical results, proving that the proposed dynamics converge to Logit-QRE under a two-timescale stochastic approximation with an explicit convergence rate of O(log k / k^{1/3}) under weak monotonicity assumptions. We further extend QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that EvoQRE achieves state-of-the-art realism, improved safety metrics, and controllable generation of diverse safety-critical scenarios through interpretable rationality parameters.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[What Drives Success in Physical Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24497v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

| **[seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03176v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-embedding self-supervised learning (SSL) commonly relies on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations, a task achieved by enforcing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations applied to two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm in SSL often limits the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between high-level invariance-demanding tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we propose \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling framework that introduces architectural inductive biases into joint-embedding predictive architectures to resolve this trade-off. Without relying on dual equivariance predictors or loss terms, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally separate representations for equivariance- and invariance-demanding tasks. To do so, our model processes short sequences of different views (observations) of inputs. Each encoded view is concatenated with an embedding of the relative transformation (action) that produces the next observation in the sequence. These view-action pairs are passed through a transformer encoder that outputs an aggregate representation. A predictor head then conditions this aggregate representation on the upcoming action to predict the representation of the next observation. Empirically, seq-JEPA demonstrates strong performance on both equivariance- and invariance-demanding downstream tasks without sacrificing one for the other. Furthermore, it excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Latent Action World Models In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05230v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.</p></details> | 37 pages, 25 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VerseCrafter_page/</p></details> |

Offline Model-based RL (MBRL) offers greater data efficiency by training policies entirely from existing datasets, but suffers from compounding errors and distribution shift in long-horizon rollouts. Although existing methods have shown success in controlled simulation benchmarks, robustly applying them to the noisy, biased, and partially observed datasets typical of real-world robotics remains challenging. We present a principled pipeline for making offline MBRL effective on physical robots. Our RWM-U extends autoregressive world models with epistemic uncertainty estimation, enabling temporally consistent multi-step rollouts with uncertainty effectively propagated over long horizons. We combine RWM-U with MOPO-PPO, which adapts uncertainty-penalized policy optimization to the stable, on-policy PPO framework for real-world control. We evaluate our approach on diverse manipulation and locomotion tasks in simulation and on real quadruped and humanoid, training policies entirely from offline datasets. The resulting policies consistently outperform model-free and uncertainty-unaware model-based baselines, and fusing real-world data in model learning further yields robust policies that surpass online model-free baselines trained solely in simulation.</p></details> |  |

Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.</p></details> | 4 tables |

| **[Current Agents Fail to Leverage World Model as Tool for Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03905v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 Pa...</summary><p>36 Pages, 13 Figures, 17 Tables (Meta data updated)</p></details> |

Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MobileDreamer: Generative Sketch World Model for GUI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04035v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.</p></details> |  |
| **[PointWorld: Scaling 3D World Models for In-The-Wild Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03782v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

| **[From Human Intention to Action Prediction: Intention-Driven End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12302v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While end-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress in geometric control, current systems remain constrained by a command-following paradigm that relies on simple navigational instructions. Transitioning to genuinely intelligent agents requires the capability to interpret and fulfill high-level, abstract human intentions. However, this advancement is hindered by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and semantic-aware evaluation metrics. In this paper, we formally define the task of Intention-Driven End-to-End Autonomous Driving and present Intention-Drive, a comprehensive benchmark designed to bridge this gap. We construct a large-scale dataset featuring complex natural language intentions paired with high-fidelity sensor data. To overcome the limitations of conventional trajectory-based metrics, we introduce the Imagined Future Alignment (IFA), a novel evaluation protocol leveraging generative world models to assess the semantic fulfillment of human goals beyond mere geometric accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the solution space by proposing two distinct paradigms: an end-to-end vision-language planner and a hierarchical agent-based framework. The experiments reveal a critical dichotomy where existing models exhibit satisfactory driving stability but struggle significantly with intention fulfillment. Notably, the proposed frameworks demonstrate superior alignment with human intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs See Without Pixels? Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence from Textual Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03590v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Belief-State World Model for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03517v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view, possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four field-of-view indicators in augmented reality and conducted a human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in a collaborative assembly task regarding accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum of positions: two at robot's eye and head space -- deepening eye socket and adding blocks to two sides of the eyes (i.e., egocentric), and two anchoring in the robot's task space -- adding extended blocks from the sides of eyes to the table and placing blocks directly on the tables (i.e., allocentric). Results showed that, when placed directly in the task space, the allocentric indicator yields the highest accuracy, although with a delay in interpreting the robot's field of view. When placed at the robot's eyes, the egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our augmented reality indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities. Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency. This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\%-73.3\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Grounded Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available here: https://github.com/r2llab/GTTA</p></details> |

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale this principle to realistic tasks and show that long-horizon planning is critical for reducing value overestimation once conservatism is removed. To make this feasible, we introduce key design choices for performing and learning from long-horizon rollouts while controlling compounding errors. These yield our algorithm, NEUBAY, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, NEUBAY generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with rollout horizons of several hundred steps, contrary to dominant practice. Finally, we characterize datasets by quality and coverage, showing when NEUBAY is preferable to conservative methods. Together, we argue NEUBAY lays the foundation for a new practical direction in offline and model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (52 pages, 15 figures) and code is available at https://github.com/twni2016/neubay</p></details> |

This survey synthesizes the emerging landscape of AI agent architectures across: (i) deliberation and reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought-style decomposition, self-reflection and verification, and constraint-aware decision making), (ii) planning and control (from reactive policies to hierarchical and multi-step planners), and (iii) tool calling and environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, and multimodal perception). We organize prior work into a unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, and critics), orchestration patterns (single-agent vs.\ multi-agent; centralized vs.\ decentralized coordination), and deployment settings (offline analysis vs.\ online interactive assistance; safety-critical vs.\ open-ended tasks). We discuss key design trade-offs -- latency vs.\ accuracy, autonomy vs.\ controllability, and capability vs.\ reliability -- and highlight how evaluation is complicated by non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, tool and environment variability, and hidden costs such as retries and context growth. Finally, we summarize measurement and benchmarking practices (task suites, human preference and utility metrics, success under constraints, robustness and security) and identify open challenges including verification and guardrails for tool actions, scalable memory and context management, interpretability of agent decisions, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads.</p></details> |  |

We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI-26 Bridge Program B10: Making Embodied AI Reliable with Testing and Formal Verification</p></details> |

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality.

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment. This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Equivariant World Models: Memory for Partially Observed Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01075v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied systems experience the world as 'a symphony of flows': a combination of many continuous streams of sensory input coupled to self-motion, interwoven with the dynamics of external objects. These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

| **[Aerial World Model for Long-horizon Visual Generation and Navigation in 3D Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21887v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent work explores large language model (LLM) agents as synthetic users, yet they typically rely on few-shot prompting, which yields a shallow understanding of the environment and limits their ability to faithfully reproduce user actions. We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels.</p></details> |  |

We first identify a common limitation of scalability in current 4D world modeling methods, caused either by expensive and specialized multi-view 4D data or by cumbersome training pre-processing. In contrast, our NeoVerse is built upon a core philosophy that makes the full pipeline scalable to diverse in-the-wild monocular videos. Specifically, NeoVerse features pose-free feed-forward 4D reconstruction, online monocular degradation pattern simulation, and other well-aligned techniques.

Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figuers, 9 tables, Submitted in conference 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS 2026)</p></details> |

In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 accepted.

While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveLaW:Unifying Planning and Video Generation in a Latent Driving World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23421v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases. The code is available at https://github.com/raktimgg/osvi-wm.</p></details> |  |
| **[World model inspired sarcasm reasoning with large language model agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24329v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Emotional World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24149v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content. We hope PhyAVBench will stimulate future progress in this critical yet largely unexplored domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 maj...</summary><p>6 major physical dimensions, 50 fine-grained test points, 1,000 groups of variable-controlled test samples</p></details> |

Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23676v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

| **[Act2Goal: From World Model To General Goal-conditioned Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23541v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

LidarDM stands out with two unprecedented capabilities in LiDAR generative modeling: (i) LiDAR generation guided by driving scenarios, offering significant potential for autonomous driving simulations, and (ii) 4D LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling the creation of realistic and temporally coherent sequences. At the heart of our model is a novel integrated 4D world generation framework. Specifically, we employ latent diffusion models to generate the 3D scene, combine it with dynamic actors to form the underlying 4D world, and subsequently produce realistic sensory observations within this virtual environment. Our experiments indicate that our approach outperforms competing algorithms in realism, temporal coherency, and layout consistency. We additionally show that LidarDM can be used as a generative world model simulator for training and testing perception models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianDWM: 3D Gaussian Driving World Model for Unified Scene Understanding and Multi-Modal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23180v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.</p></details> |  |
