| **[SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

| **[VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

| **[villa-X: Enhancing Latent Action Modeling in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23682v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/villa-x</p></details> |
| **[SQAP-VLA: A Synergistic Quantization-Aware Pruning Framework for High-Performance Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09090v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08820v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06932v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[TA-VLA: Elucidating the Design Space of Torque-aware Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07962v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |
| **[EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21112v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06951v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[CRISP -- Compliant ROS2 Controllers for Learning-Based Manipulation Policies and Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06819v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[4D Visual Pre-training for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17230v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</p></details> | 8pages, 10 figures, |
| **[OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OpenEgo, a multimodal egocentric manipulation dataset with standardized hand-pose annotations and intention-aligned action primitives. OpenEgo totals 1107 hours across six public datasets, covering 290 manipulation tasks in 600+ environments. We unify hand-pose layouts and provide descriptive, timestamped action primitives. To validate its utility, we train language-conditioned imitation-learning policies to predict dexterous hand trajectories. OpenEgo is designed to lower the barrier to learning dexterous manipulation from egocentric video and to support reproducible research in vision-language-action learning. All resources and instructions will be released at www.openegocentric.com.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[FLOWER: Democratizing Generalist Robot Policies with Efficient Vision-Language-Action Flow Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04996v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

| **[Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through Unified Latent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02055v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FPC-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework with a Supervisor for Failure Prediction and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04018v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments.

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://opengalaxea.github.io/G0/</p></details> |

However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025; Github Page: https://long-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

However, prevailing VLA decoders either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone, demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[FlowVLA: Thinking in Motion with a Visual Chain of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$). This paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \textbf{conflates} the task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static appearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling often leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by compelling the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame's \textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this principle by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction. By forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns disentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and significantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code is provided in our github repository.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

These models rely on multimodal inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that (i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii) engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, due to the heterogeneity of tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories. With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks.

However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-Generalist: Self-Improving Vision-Language-Action Models for Crafting 3D Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06484v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |
| **[CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions, but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Actions in Camera Space: Observation-Centric Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13103v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA) framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models particularly the Vision Language Action (VLA) models have emerged to fuse multimodal perception, reasoning and physically grounded action across varied embodiments into unified representation, termed as General Physical Intelligence (GPI). While GPI has already been described in the literature but its practical application and evolving role in contemporary agile manufacturing processes have yet to be duly explored. To bridge this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advancements in VLA models within GPI context, performs comprehensive comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluates their readiness for industrial deployment through structured ablation study. Our analysis has organized state-of-the-art into five thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, we articulate open research challenges and propose directions to better integrate GPI into next-generation industrial ecosystems in line with Industry 5.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> |

However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and robotic system models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in IROS 2023 Workshop (Multilimb Coordination in Human Neuroscience and Robotics: Classical and Learning Perspectives)</p></details> |

FWMAVs try to adapt and emulate the flight features of birds and flying insects. While current designs already achieve high manoeuvrability, they still almost entirely lack perching and take-off abilities. These capabilities could, for instance, enable long-term monitoring and surveillance missions, and operations in cluttered environments or in proximity to humans and animals. We present the development and testing of a framework that enables repeatable perching and take-off for small to medium-sized FWMAVs, utilising soft, non-damaging grippers. Thanks to its novel active-passive actuation system, an energy-conserving state can be achieved and indefinitely maintained while the vehicle is perched. A prototype of the proposed system weighing under 39 g was manufactured and extensively tested on a 110 g flapping-wing robot. Successful free-flight tests demonstrated the full mission cycle of landing, perching and subsequent take-off. The telemetry data recorded during the flights yields extensive insight into the system's behaviour and is a valuable step towards full automation and optimisation of the entire take-off and landing cycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 5 multimedia extensions</p></details> |

Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions, as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for automating and scaling social robot control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 demo-video and repository link</p></details> |
| **[GundamQ: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Robust Robot Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10305v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Environmental force sensing helps robots traverse cluttered large obstacles using physical interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07900v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications require robots to move through complex 3-D terrain with large obstacles, such as self-driving, search and rescue, and extraterrestrial exploration. Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse obstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make progress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical interaction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches can use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to traverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by this, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots make active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a physics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing environmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a force-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed contact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated stiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more favorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing induced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly roll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less energy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always avoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of beams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the robot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the robustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness in oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a shorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant limitation of RAMIS is the surgeon's inability to palpate tissues, a crucial technique for examining tissue properties and detecting abnormalities, restricting the widespread adoption of RAMIS. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce MiniTac, a novel vision-based tactile sensor with an ultra-compact cross-sectional diameter of 8 mm, designed for seamless integration into mainstream RAMIS devices, particularly the Da Vinci surgical systems. MiniTac features a novel mechanoresponsive photonic elastomer membrane that changes color distribution under varying contact pressures. This color change is captured by an embedded miniature camera, allowing MiniTac to detect tumors both on the tissue surface and in deeper layers typically obscured from endoscopic view. MiniTac's efficacy has been rigorously tested on both phantoms and ex-vivo tissues. By leveraging advanced mechanoresponsive photonic materials, MiniTac represents a significant advancement in integrating tactile sensing into RAMIS, potentially expanding its applicability to a wider array of clinical scenarios that currently rely on traditional surgical approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Despite significant advances in replicating human hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (p<0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering new perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Learning-Based Control of a Legged Robot in Lunar Gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10128v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.</p></details> |  |

As a promising solution, Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) offer high spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness, but present unique challenges in robotics for their complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing requirements. The lack of efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTSs has significantly limited the scale and scope of tactile robotics research. We present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research and development, potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physical environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02986v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain. However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1. Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving robust flight performance under environmental airflow disturbances remains a critical challenge, thereby limiting their broader deployment. Inspired by avian flight mechanics, particularly the ability of birds to perch and stabilize in turbulent wind conditions, this article introduces RGBlimp-Q -- a robotic gliding blimp equipped with a bird-inspired continuum arm featuring a novel moving mass actuation mechanism. This continuum arm enables flexible attitude regulation through internal mass redistribution, significantly enhancing the system's resilience to external disturbances. In addition, it facilitates aerial manipulation by employing end-effector claws that interact with the environment in a manner analogous to avian perching behavior. This article presents the design, modeling, and prototyping of RGBlimp-Q, supported by comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative analysis. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first interdisciplinary integration of continuum mechanisms into a lighter-than-air robotic platform, where the continuum arm simultaneously functions as both an actuation and manipulation module. This design establishes a novel paradigm for robotic blimps, expanding their applicability to complex and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

By enabling compliant robot motions, collisions between the robot and its environment become more tolerable and can thus be exploited, but more physical uncertainties are introduced. To address contact-rich problems such as occluded object grasping while handling the involved uncertainties, we propose a collision-inclusive planning framework that can transition the robot to a desired task configuration via roughly modeled collisions absorbed by Cartesian impedance control. By strategically exploiting the environmental constraints and exploring inside a manipulation funnel formed by task repetitions, our framework can effectively reduce physical and perception uncertainties. With real-world evaluations on both single-arm and dual-arm setups, we show that our framework is able to efficiently address various realistic occluded grasping problems where a feasible grasp does not initially exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Many traditional methods generate robot-centric actions, which differ from intuitive human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Diffusion-based Multi-task Learning with Online Reinforcement Learning for Robust Quadruped Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05674v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of Anomalous Behavior in Robot Systems Based on Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09953v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct scenarios using CoppeliaSim and comparatively evaluated several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in a quadcopter context (Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a comparative approach and demonstrates the particular strengths of autoencoders for detecting complex anomalies in robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

| **[Using the Pepper Robot to Support Sign Language Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09889v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robots are increasingly experimented in public and assistive settings, but their accessibility for Deaf users remains quite underexplored. Italian Sign Language (LIS) is a fully-fledged natural language that relies on complex manual and non-manual components. Enabling robots to communicate using LIS could foster more inclusive human robot interaction, especially in social environments such as hospitals, airports, or educational settings. This study investigates whether a commercial social robot, Pepper, can produce intelligible LIS signs and short signed LIS sentences. With the help of a Deaf student and his interpreter, an expert in LIS, we co-designed and implemented 52 LIS signs on Pepper using either manual animation techniques or a MATLAB based inverse kinematics solver. We conducted a exploratory user study involving 12 participants proficient in LIS, both Deaf and hearing. Participants completed a questionnaire featuring 15 single-choice video-based sign recognition tasks and 2 open-ended questions on short signed sentences. Results shows that the majority of isolated signs were recognized correctly, although full sentence recognition was significantly lower due to Pepper's limited articulation and temporal constraints. Our findings demonstrate that even commercially available social robots like Pepper can perform a subset of LIS signs intelligibly, offering some opportunities for a more inclusive interaction design. Future developments should address multi-modal enhancements (e.g., screen-based support or expressive avatars) and involve Deaf users in participatory design to refine robot expressivity and usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>paper...</summary><p>paper presented at ICSR2025</p></details> |

Typically, traditional interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion, especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance compared to two baseline controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 22nd International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotic - ICINCO 2025</p></details> |

In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time. To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher success rates in the real world.

Locating and Grasping Objects by a Robot Arm Covered with Sensitive Skin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17986v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real robot for one object was 85.7% with failures mainly while grasping specific objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception (due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue for robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. This paper introduces a novel method for acquiring real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset GlassNICOLDataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The dataset consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and Accepted for Presentation at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design, making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments. However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration, while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and (3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

Accurate environmental prediction and effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field conditions.

| **[Sampling-Based Multi-Modal Multi-Robot Multi-Goal Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03509v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many robotics applications, multiple robots are working in a shared workspace to complete a set of tasks as fast as possible. Such settings can be treated as multi-modal multi-robot multi-goal path planning problems, where each robot has to reach a set of goals. Existing approaches to this type of problem solve this using prioritization or assume synchronous task completion, and are thus neither optimal nor complete. We formalize this problem as a single centralized path planning problem and present planners that are probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. The planners plan in the composite space of all robots and are modifications of standard sampling-based planners with the required changes to work in our multi-modal, multi-robot, multi-goal setting. We validate the planners on a diverse range of problems including scenarios with various robots, planning horizons, and collaborative tasks such as handovers, and compare the planners against a suboptimal prioritized planner. Videos and code for the planners and the benchmark is available at https://vhartmann.com/mrmg-planning/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While prior work has focused on pairwise separations between models, we explore how robot capabilities, light observability, and scheduler synchrony interact in more complex ways. We first show that the Exponential Times Expansion (ETE) problem is solvable only in the strongest model -- fully-synchronous robots with full mutual lights ($\mathcal{LUMT}^F$). We then introduce the Hexagonal Edge Traversal (HET) and TAR(d)* problems to demonstrate how internal memory and lights interact with synchrony: under weak synchrony, internal memory alone is insufficient, while full synchrony can substitute for both lights and memory. In the asynchronous setting, we classify problems such as LP-MLCv, VEC, and ZCC to show fine-grained separations between $\mathcal{FSTA}$ and $\mathcal{FCOM}$ robots. We also analyze Vertex Traversal Rendezvous (VTR) and Leave Place Convergence (LP-Cv), illustrating the limitations of internal memory in symmetric settings. These results extend the known separation map of 14 canonical robot models, revealing structural phenomena only visible through higher-order comparisons. Our work provides new impossibility criteria and deepens the understanding of how observability, memory, and synchrony collectively shape the computational power of mobile robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field. Our project is open-sourced at https://socialminigames.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09106v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, equal authorship between Kevin Fu and Shalin Anand Jain Manuscript accepted for publication at the 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

Specifically, EEG-based motor imagery systems are still error-prone, posing safety risks when rigid robots operate near humans. This work presents an alternative pathway towards safe and effective operation by combining wearable EEG with physically embodied safety in soft robots. We introduce and test a pipeline that allows a user to move a soft robot's end effector in real time via brain waves that are measured by as few as three EEG channels. A robust motor imagery algorithm interprets the user's intentions to move the position of a virtual attractor to which the end effector is attracted, thanks to a new Cartesian impedance controller. We specifically focus here on planar soft robot-based architected metamaterials, which require the development of a novel control architecture to deal with the peculiar nonlinearities - e.g., non-affinity in control. We preliminarily but quantitatively evaluate the approach on the task of setpoint regulation. We observe that the user reaches the proximity of the setpoint in 66% of steps and that for successful steps, the average response time is 21.5s. We also demonstrate the execution of simple real-world tasks involving interaction with the environment, which would be extremely hard to perform if it were not for the robot's softness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, presented at 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (2024)</p></details> |

It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on Working towards Ontology-based Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2023 - 2nd Edition), Jun 2023, Londres, United Kingdom</p></details> |

There is a gap between what is developed in laboratories and what would be viable in real-world contexts. Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions) including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct relation to frailty, can help promote design thinking that addresses people's needs in a more pragmatic way to move assistive robotics closer to real-world use.</p></details> |  |

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents share inaccurate state information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots.

Unlike existing datasets that rely on synthetic models or specialized objects with limited accessibility, ASOS provides a cost-effective collection of common household items that can be sourced from a major Australian supermarket chain. The dataset spans 10 distinct categories with diverse shapes, sizes, and weights. 3D meshes are acquired by a structure-from-motion techniques with high-resolution imaging to generate watertight meshes. The dataset's emphasis on accessibility and real-world applicability makes it valuable for benchmarking object detection, pose estimation, and robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi Robot Coordination in Highly Dynamic Environments: Tackling Asymmetric Obstacles and Limited Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08859v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions. Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS 19), 2025, Genoa</p></details> |
| **[Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robot Grasp Detection with Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08126v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates. Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning, improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning design.

In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\% and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness, achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |
| **[RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich, deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution, even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation. To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors, which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering emotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can prompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like processes it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We engage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon prevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can influence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances users can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened interactions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction and highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we apply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order to reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this investigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more ethical and informed human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Journal of Social Robotics. 18 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, many existing variable stiffness solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation; and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable morphology and task-adaptive interaction.</p></details> |  |

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |
| **[TASC: Task-Aware Shared Control for Teleoperated Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10416v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TASC, a Task-Aware Shared Control framework for teleoperated manipulation that infers task-level user intent and provides assistance throughout the task. To support everyday tasks without predefined knowledge, TASC constructs an open-vocabulary interaction graph from visual input to represent functional object relationships, and infers user intent accordingly. A shared control policy then provides rotation assistance during both grasping and object interaction, guided by spatial constraints predicted by a vision-language model. Our method addresses two key challenges in general-purpose, long-horizon shared control: (1) understanding and inferring task-level user intent, and (2) generalizing assistance across diverse objects and tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that TASC improves task efficiency and reduces user input effort compared to prior methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared control framework that supports everyday manipulation tasks with zero-shot generalization. The code that supports our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/fitz0401/tasc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Visual Grounding in Visual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10345v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which collect and process limited scene-aware contexts. In contrast, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors such as LiDAR provide rich depth and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Even better the emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar detects the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. The integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, thereby supporting more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, we propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar sensors. To optimally combine the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we design a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds both-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Moreover, we design a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge to the ego-vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets. We release the code at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/TPCNet.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

Despite this, accurately localizing answers within documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce \textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we build on the popular LLaVA framework to systematically explore model architectures and training strategies for both 2D and 3D medical LVLMs. We present extensive empirical findings and practical guidance.

However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic, and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash.

Nevertheless, empirical evidence reveals a tendency of existing methods that they overfit seen classes and exhibit degraded performance on unseen classes. This limitation is due to the inherent bias in the training data towards the seen classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard prompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft prompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of soft prompts on unseen classes. Moreover, the proposed MoPD method utilizes a gating network that learns to select hard prompts used for prompt distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoPD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines especially on on unseen classes.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself.

| **[Data Matters Most: Auditing Social Bias in Contrastive Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13223v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) deliver strong zero-shot recognition but frequently inherit social biases from their training data. We systematically disentangle three design factors -- model size, training-data scale, and training-data source -- by comparing CLIP and OpenCLIP, two models that share an identical contrastive objective yet differ in encoder width and in the image-text corpora on which they are pre-trained (400M proprietary pairs vs. 400M/2B LAION). Across balanced face-analysis benchmarks, enlarging the encoder reduces gender skew in CLIP but amplifies both gender and racial skew in OpenCLIP; increasing the LAION corpus from 400M to 2B further increases OpenCLIP bias. At matched model and data budgets, substituting proprietary data with LAION improves gender fairness while increasing racial skew, underscoring data source as the primary driver of bias patterns. We also evaluate three post-hoc, test-time debiasing strategies -- Bias Prompts, Prompt Array, and SANER. Debiasing reduces but does not eliminate harm, and its effectiveness is source- and size-dependent: Bias Prompts most effectively reduce gender skew in CLIP at smaller model sizes, whereas Prompt Array and SANER more reliably reduce racial skew in OpenCLIP; scaling LAION reconfigures which method is most fair. Taken together, these findings challenge the assumption that bigger models or datasets are automatically fairer and foreground training data source as the key determinant of both bias and mitigation efficacy. We release code and evaluation scripts to enable transparent, reproducible auditing of future VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Language Barriers or Reinforcing Bias? A Study of Gender and Racial Disparities in Multilingual Contrastive Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14160v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain underexplored. We perform the first systematic audit of four public multilingual CLIP variants: M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, CAPIVARA-CLIP, and the debiased SigLIP-2, covering ten languages that differ in resource availability and morphological gender marking. Using balanced subsets of FairFace and the PATA stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the intuition that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender skew than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared encoder of NLLB-CLIP and SigLIP-2 transfers English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this leakage. Although SigLIP-2 reduces agency and communion skews, it inherits -- and in caption-sparse contexts (e.g., Xhosa) amplifies -- the English anchor's crime associations. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all bias types, yet gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable whenever cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics thus mask language-specific hot spots, underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual VLM research.</p></details> |  |

Recent works show that pretrained foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), capture background knowledge helpful for planning, which reduces the amount of reward design and demonstrations needed for policy learning. We evaluate how well LLMs and VLMs provide feedback across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. We consider prominent types of feedback for planning including binary feedback, preference feedback, action advising, goal advising, and delta action feedback. We also consider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics. We find that foundation models can provide diverse high-quality feedback across domains. Moreover, larger and reasoning models consistently provide more accurate feedback, exhibit less bias, and benefit more from enhanced inference methods. Finally, feedback quality degrades for environments with complex dynamics or continuous state spaces and action spaces.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation.

While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for zero-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to further improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/ant-8/GUI-Grounding-via-Iterative-Narrowing</p></details> |

Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

| **[World Modeling with Probabilistic Structure Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09737v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction, involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data, corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomly Sampled Language Reasoning Problems Elucidate Limitations of In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02825v6)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs have revolutionized the field of machine learning due to their high performance on a strikingly wide range of problems, they are also known to hallucinate false answers and underperform on less canonical versions of the same tasks. There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

| **[One Model for All Tasks: Leveraging Efficient World Models in Multi-Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07945v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.</p></details> | 43 pages, 19 figures |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |
| **[When Do Neural Networks Learn World Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09297v5)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions--even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; ICLR 2025 World Models Workshop (oral, outstanding paper award)</p></details> |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality. The source code will be available on https://github.com/xieyuser/Semi-SMD.</p></details> |  |
