| **[SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

| **[VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

| **[villa-X: Enhancing Latent Action Modeling in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23682v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/villa-x</p></details> |
| **[SQAP-VLA: A Synergistic Quantization-Aware Pruning Framework for High-Performance Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09090v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08820v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06932v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[TA-VLA: Elucidating the Design Space of Torque-aware Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07962v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |
| **[EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21112v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06951v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[CRISP -- Compliant ROS2 Controllers for Learning-Based Manipulation Policies and Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06819v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[4D Visual Pre-training for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17230v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</p></details> | 8pages, 10 figures, |
| **[OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OpenEgo, a multimodal egocentric manipulation dataset with standardized hand-pose annotations and intention-aligned action primitives. OpenEgo totals 1107 hours across six public datasets, covering 290 manipulation tasks in 600+ environments. We unify hand-pose layouts and provide descriptive, timestamped action primitives. To validate its utility, we train language-conditioned imitation-learning policies to predict dexterous hand trajectories. OpenEgo is designed to lower the barrier to learning dexterous manipulation from egocentric video and to support reproducible research in vision-language-action learning. All resources and instructions will be released at www.openegocentric.com.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[FLOWER: Democratizing Generalist Robot Policies with Efficient Vision-Language-Action Flow Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04996v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

| **[Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through Unified Latent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02055v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FPC-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework with a Supervisor for Failure Prediction and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04018v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments.

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://opengalaxea.github.io/G0/</p></details> |

However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025; Github Page: https://long-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

However, prevailing VLA decoders either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone, demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[FlowVLA: Thinking in Motion with a Visual Chain of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$). This paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \textbf{conflates} the task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static appearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling often leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by compelling the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame's \textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this principle by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction. By forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns disentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and significantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code is provided in our github repository.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

These models rely on multimodal inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that (i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii) engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, due to the heterogeneity of tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories. With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks.

Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |
| **[CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions, but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Actions in Camera Space: Observation-Centric Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13103v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA) framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models particularly the Vision Language Action (VLA) models have emerged to fuse multimodal perception, reasoning and physically grounded action across varied embodiments into unified representation, termed as General Physical Intelligence (GPI). While GPI has already been described in the literature but its practical application and evolving role in contemporary agile manufacturing processes have yet to be duly explored. To bridge this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advancements in VLA models within GPI context, performs comprehensive comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluates their readiness for industrial deployment through structured ablation study. Our analysis has organized state-of-the-art into five thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, we articulate open research challenges and propose directions to better integrate GPI into next-generation industrial ecosystems in line with Industry 5.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> |

Locating and Grasping Objects by a Robot Arm Covered with Sensitive Skin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17986v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real robot for one object was 85.7% with failures mainly while grasping specific objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception (due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue for robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. This paper introduces a novel method for acquiring real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset GlassNICOLDataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The dataset consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and Accepted for Presentation at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design, making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments. However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration, while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and (3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

Accurate environmental prediction and effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field conditions.

| **[Sampling-Based Multi-Modal Multi-Robot Multi-Goal Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03509v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many robotics applications, multiple robots are working in a shared workspace to complete a set of tasks as fast as possible. Such settings can be treated as multi-modal multi-robot multi-goal path planning problems, where each robot has to reach a set of goals. Existing approaches to this type of problem solve this using prioritization or assume synchronous task completion, and are thus neither optimal nor complete. We formalize this problem as a single centralized path planning problem and present planners that are probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. The planners plan in the composite space of all robots and are modifications of standard sampling-based planners with the required changes to work in our multi-modal, multi-robot, multi-goal setting. We validate the planners on a diverse range of problems including scenarios with various robots, planning horizons, and collaborative tasks such as handovers, and compare the planners against a suboptimal prioritized planner. Videos and code for the planners and the benchmark is available at https://vhartmann.com/mrmg-planning/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Unveiling Structural Landscape of Mobile Robot Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19805v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the computational power of mobile robot systems is a fundamental challenge in distributed computing. While prior work has focused on pairwise separations between models, we explore how robot capabilities, light observability, and scheduler synchrony interact in more complex ways. We first show that the Exponential Times Expansion (ETE) problem is solvable only in the strongest model -- fully-synchronous robots with full mutual lights ($\mathcal{LUMT}^F$). We then introduce the Hexagonal Edge Traversal (HET) and TAR(d)* problems to demonstrate how internal memory and lights interact with synchrony: under weak synchrony, internal memory alone is insufficient, while full synchrony can substitute for both lights and memory. In the asynchronous setting, we classify problems such as LP-MLCv, VEC, and ZCC to show fine-grained separations between $\mathcal{FSTA}$ and $\mathcal{FCOM}$ robots. We also analyze Vertex Traversal Rendezvous (VTR) and Leave Place Convergence (LP-Cv), illustrating the limitations of internal memory in symmetric settings. These results extend the known separation map of 14 canonical robot models, revealing structural phenomena only visible through higher-order comparisons. Our work provides new impossibility criteria and deepens the understanding of how observability, memory, and synchrony collectively shape the computational power of mobile robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field. Our project is open-sourced at https://socialminigames.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09106v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks for Flexible Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06058v5)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex and effective coordination skills. However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, equal authorship between Kevin Fu and Shalin Anand Jain Manuscript accepted for publication at the 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

Specifically, EEG-based motor imagery systems are still error-prone, posing safety risks when rigid robots operate near humans. This work presents an alternative pathway towards safe and effective operation by combining wearable EEG with physically embodied safety in soft robots. We introduce and test a pipeline that allows a user to move a soft robot's end effector in real time via brain waves that are measured by as few as three EEG channels. A robust motor imagery algorithm interprets the user's intentions to move the position of a virtual attractor to which the end effector is attracted, thanks to a new Cartesian impedance controller. We specifically focus here on planar soft robot-based architected metamaterials, which require the development of a novel control architecture to deal with the peculiar nonlinearities - e.g., non-affinity in control. We preliminarily but quantitatively evaluate the approach on the task of setpoint regulation. We observe that the user reaches the proximity of the setpoint in 66% of steps and that for successful steps, the average response time is 21.5s. We also demonstrate the execution of simple real-world tasks involving interaction with the environment, which would be extremely hard to perform if it were not for the robot's softness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, presented at 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Ontological Component-based Description of Robot Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07569v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key aspect of a robot's knowledge base is self-awareness about what it is capable of doing. It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on Working towards Ontology-based Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2023 - 2nd Edition), Jun 2023, Londres, United Kingdom</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating the Emergence of Assistive Robots to Support Frailty: Psychosocial and Environmental Realities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08510v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While assistive robots have much potential to help older people with frailty-related needs, there are few in use. There is a gap between what is developed in laboratories and what would be viable in real-world contexts. Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions) including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct relation to frailty, can help promote design thinking that addresses people's needs in a more pragmatic way to move assistive robotics closer to real-world use.</p></details> |  |

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Typically, traditional interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion, especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance compared to two baseline controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 22nd International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotic - ICINCO 2025</p></details> |

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents share inaccurate state information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and will appear at 2025 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Multi Robot Coordination in Highly Dynamic Environments: Tackling Asymmetric Obstacles and Limited Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08859v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions. Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS 19), 2025, Genoa</p></details> |
| **[Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robot Grasp Detection with Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08126v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates. Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning, improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning design.

In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\% and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness, achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop AIR4S</p></details> |
| **[RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich, deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution, even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation. To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors, which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering emotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can prompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like processes it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We engage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon prevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can influence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances users can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened interactions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction and highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we apply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order to reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this investigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more ethical and informed human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Journal of Social Robotics. 18 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, many existing variable stiffness solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation; and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable morphology and task-adaptive interaction.</p></details> |  |

Active listening and backchanneling could be one way to enhance robots' communicative capabilities and enhance their effectiveness in eliciting deeper self-disclosure, providing a sense of empathy,and forming positive rapport and relationships with people.Thus, we developed an LLM-powered social robot that can exhibit contextually appropriate sentiment-based backchannelingand active listening behaviors (active listening+backchanneling) and compared its efficacy in eliciting people's self-disclosurein comparison to robots that do not exhibit any of these listening behaviors (control) and a robot that only exhibitsbackchanneling behavior (backchanneling-only). Through ourexperimental study with sixty-five participants, we found theparticipants who conversed with the active listening robot per-ceived the interactions more positively, in which they exhibited the highest self-disclosures, and reported the strongest senseof being listened to. The results of our study suggest that the implementation of active listening behaviors in social robotshas the potential to improve human-robot communication andcould further contribute to the building of deeper human-robot relationships and rapport.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Tree Search with Tensor Factorization for Robot Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04949v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, long-horizon correlation, and multi-modal landscapes, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. Monte Carlo Tree Search is a powerful approach that can strategically explore the solution space and can be applied to a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios. However, it typically suffers from combinatorial complexity when applied to robotics, resulting in slow convergence and high memory demands. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit correlations among decision variables arising from common kinematic structures, dynamic constraints, and environmental interactions in robot decision-making. This yields a compact, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, legged robot manipulation, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |

In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used in any typical mobile robot application.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link https://trojanrobot.github.io.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Due to the complexity of joint configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a 9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks. RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29 times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task completion rate in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication, computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster, more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the differences in frequency band sensitivity between CNNs and the human visual system (mid-frequency sensitivity with low-frequency sensitivity surpassing high-frequency), we experimentally quantified the CNN contrast sensitivity function and proposed a wavelet adaptive spectrum fusion (WASF) method inspired by biological vision mechanisms to balance cross-frequency image features. Furthermore, we designed a perception frequency block (PFB) that integrates WASF to enhance frequency-domain feature extraction. Based on this, we developed the FE-UNet model, which employs a SAM2 backbone network and incorporates fine-tuned Hiera-Large modules to ensure segmentation accuracy while improving generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that FE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain tasks such as marine organism segmentation and polyp segmentation, showcasing robust adaptability and significant application potential.

Recently, researchers achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching, we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping. We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we propose a low computational complexity and high accuracy model named VMGNet for robotic grasping. For the first time, we introduce the Visual State Space into the robotic grasping field to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby greatly reducing the model's computational cost. Meanwhile, to improve the accuracy of the model, we propose an efficient and lightweight multi-scale feature fusion module, named Fusion Bridge Module, to extract and fuse information at different scales. We also present a new loss function calculation method to enhance the importance differences between subtasks, improving the model's fitting ability. Experiments show that VMGNet has only 8.7G Floating Point Operations and an inference time of 8.1 ms on our devices. VMGNet also achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Cornell and Jacquard public datasets. To validate VMGNet's effectiveness in practical applications, we conducted real grasping experiments in multi-object scenarios, and VMGNet achieved an excellent performance with a 94.4% success rate in real-world grasping tasks. The video for the real-world robotic grasping experiments is available at https://youtu.be/S-QHBtbmLc4.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is part of ongoing research, and we are further developing new techniques based on these results.

| **[Quantum Machine Learning and Grover's Algorithm for Quantum Optimization of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07216v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity. Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational, quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging quantum computing and robotics problems.</p></details> |  |
| **["It was Tragic": Exploring the Impact of a Robot's Shutdown](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06934v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well established that people perceive robots as social entities, even when they are not designed for social interaction. We evaluated whether the social interpretation of robotic gestures should also be considered when turning off a robot. In the experiment, participants engaged in a brief preliminary neutral interaction while a robotic arm showed interest in their actions. At the end of the task, participants were asked to turn off the robotic arm under two conditions: (1) a Non-designed condition, where all of the robot's engines were immediately and simultaneously turned off, as robots typically shut down; (2) a Designed condition, where the robot's engines gradually folded inward in a motion resembling "falling asleep." Our findings revealed that all participants anthropomorphized the robot's movement when it was turned off. In the Non-designed condition, most participants interpreted the robot's turn-off movement negatively, as if the robot had "died." In the Designed condition, most participants interpreted it more neutrally, stating that the robot "went to sleep." The robot's turn-off movement also impacted its perception, leading to higher likeability, perceived intelligence, and animacy in the Designed condition. We conclude that the impact of common edge interactions, such as turning off a robot, should be carefully designed while considering people's automatic tendency to perceive robots as social entities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |

Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Real-World HRI in Public and Private Spaces: Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned (PubRob-Fails), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference, 2025. 6 pages</p></details> |

Embodying proactive mitigation improves safety and operational continuity. This paper presents a multimodal anomaly detection and mitigation system that integrates vision-language models and large language models to identify and report hazardous situations and conflicts in real-time. The proposed system enables robots to perceive, interpret, report, and if possible respond to urban and environmental anomalies through proactive detection mechanisms and automated mitigation actions. A key contribution in this paper is the integration of Hazardous and Conflict states into the robot's decision-making framework, where each anomaly type can trigger specific mitigation strategies. User studies (n = 30) demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in anomaly detection with 91.2% prediction accuracy and relatively low latency response times using edge-ai architecture.</p></details> |  |

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency FURUTA pendulum platform.

| **[ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision + tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Previous work only considered two robots. In this paper, we present an $O(mn)$ time algorithm, where $m$ is the complexity of the polygon, when all the starting positions lie on a line segment $S$, all the target positions lie on a line segment $T$, and $S$ and $T$ do not intersect. We also argue that there is no polynomial-time algorithm, whose running time depends only on $n$ and $m$, that uses a single strategy for the case where $S$ and $T$ intersect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of Indoor Open Street Maps for Robot Navigation from CAD Files](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00552v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of autonomous mobile robots is predicated on the availability of environmental maps, yet conventional generation via SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) suffers from significant limitations in time, labor, and robustness, particularly in dynamic, large-scale indoor environments where map obsolescence can lead to critical localization failures. To address these challenges, this paper presents a complete and automated system for converting architectural Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files into a hierarchical topometric OpenStreetMap (OSM) representation, tailored for robust life-long robot navigation. Our core methodology involves a multi-stage pipeline that first isolates key structural layers from the raw CAD data and then employs an AreaGraph-based topological segmentation to partition the building layout into a hierarchical graph of navigable spaces. This process yields a comprehensive and semantically rich map, further enhanced by automatically associating textual labels from the CAD source and cohesively merging multiple building floors into a unified, topologically-correct model. By leveraging the permanent structural information inherent in CAD files, our system circumvents the inefficiencies and fragility of SLAM, offering a practical and scalable solution for deploying robots in complex indoor spaces. The software is encapsulated within an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate practical use.

To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation.

Previous work examined whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks. We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding (MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to: 2025 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), Naples, Italy, Nov 2-5, 2025.

| **[Focusing by Contrastive Attention: Enhancing VLMs' Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06461v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in High-Energy Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08461v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Clinical and Class-Agnostic Features for Reliable Few-Shot Adaptation under Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09397v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at https://github.com/rumaima/DRiFt.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

| **[Curriculum-Based Multi-Tier Semantic Exploration via Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09356v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents. Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS 19), 2025, Genoa</p></details> |

Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/gonikisgo/bmvc2025-vlm-image-recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each task.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field.

| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.VLJailbreakBench is publicly available at https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Ideal and Real-world Evaluation: Benchmarking AI-Generated Image Detection in Challenging Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09172v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility. Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

Leveraging multi modal prompts that combine textual and audio derived signals, DEEVISum incorporates Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) and Early Exit (EE) to strike a balance between performance and efficiency. MSKD offers a 1.33% absolute F1 improvement over baseline distillation (0.5%), while EE reduces inference time by approximately 21% with a 1.3 point drop in F1. Evaluated on the TVSum dataset, our best model PaLI Gemma2 3B + MSKD achieves an F1 score of 61.1, competing the performance of significantly larger models, all while maintaining a lower computational footprint.

| **[Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07815v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://ive-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Hierarchical Plant Segmentation via Foundation Segmentation Models and Text-to-image Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09116v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However, segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods. Implementations are available at https://github.com/JunhaoXing/ZeroPlantSeg.</p></details> | WACV 2026 accepted |

The absence of large-scale, high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000 images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency; low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors, highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor. These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Monjo...</summary><p>Monjoy Narayan Choudhury and Junling Wang contributed equally to this work.

| **[Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

| **[RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Byted...</summary><p>Bytedance Seed Technical Report</p></details> |

Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Have Large Vision-Language Models Mastered Art History?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03521v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. We examine whether their multimodal reasoning can also address a challenge mastered by human experts. Specifically, we test whether VLMs can classify the style, author and creation date of paintings, a domain traditionally mastered by art historians. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. This requires a contextual and stylistic interpretation rather than straightforward object recognition. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively reason about the historical and stylistic attributes of paintings. We present the first study of its kind, conducting an in-depth analysis of three VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4o, evaluating their zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period. Using two image benchmarks of artworks, we assess the models' ability to interpret style, evaluate their sensitivity to prompts, and examine failure cases. Additionally, we focus on how these models compare to human art historical expertise by analyzing misclassifications, providing insights into their reasoning and classification patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCPO: Thought-Centric Preference Optimization for Effective Embodied Decision-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08500v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs) in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency, and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6% improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models in embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges, computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD, but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further research on optimization techniques.</p></details> | 72 Pages, 11 Figures |

In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</p></details> |  |

Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLAMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at "mixed precision" through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLAMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLAMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLAMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

While they excel at many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics, remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over 400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Examining Vision Language Models through Multi-dimensional Experiments with Vision and Text Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08266v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g., with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size, number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and, subsequently, its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design insights for discovery over digital libraries.

By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding.

To address these issues, we propose a visual prior-guided vision-language model, PriorCLIP, which leverages visual priors for unbiased representation learning and adaptive vision-language alignment. In the closed-domain setting, PriorCLIP introduces two Progressive Attention Encoder (PAE) structures: Spatial-PAE constructs a belief matrix with instruction embeddings to filter key features and mitigate semantic bias. At the same time, Temporal-PAE exploits cyclic activation across time steps to enhance text representation. For the open-domain setting, we design a two-stage prior representation learning strategy, consisting of large-scale pre-training on coarse-grained image-text pairs, followed by fine-tuning on fine-grained pairs using vision-instruction, which enables robust retrieval across long-tail concepts and vocabulary shifts. Furthermore, a cluster-based symmetric contrastive Attribution Loss is proposed to constrain inter-class relations and alleviate semantic confusion in the shared embedding space. Extensive experiments on RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that PriorCLIP achieves substantial improvements, outperforming existing methods by 4.9% and 4.0% in closed-domain retrieval, and by 7.3% and 9.4% in open-domain retrieval, respectively.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding.

| **[Visual-TableQA: Open-Domain Benchmark for Reasoning over Table Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07966v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale, open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular, scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full pipeline and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/AI-4-Everyone/Visual-TableQA.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07613v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[InteractPro: A Unified Framework for Motion-Aware Image Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10090v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InteractPro, a comprehensive framework for dynamic motion-aware image composition. At its core is InteractPlan, an intelligent planner that leverages a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) for scenario analysis and object placement, determining the optimal composition strategy to achieve realistic motion effects. Based on each scenario, InteractPlan selects between our two specialized modules: InteractPhys and InteractMotion. InteractPhys employs an enhanced Material Point Method (MPM)-based simulation to produce physically faithful and controllable object-scene interactions, capturing diverse and abstract events that require true physical modeling. InteractMotion, in contrast, is a training-free method based on pretrained video diffusion. Traditional composition approaches suffer from two major limitations: requiring manual planning for object placement and generating static, motionless outputs. By unifying simulation-based and diffusion-based methods under planner guidance, InteractPro overcomes these challenges, ensuring richly motion-aware compositions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate InteractPro's effectiveness in producing controllable, and coherent compositions across varied scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Visual Navigation Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07488v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original BLIP-2 model.</p></details> |  |
| **[DepthVision: Robust Vision-Language Understanding through GAN-Based LiDAR-to-RGB Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07463v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation, such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot operation in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **["Humor, Art, or Misinformation?": A Multimodal Dataset for Intent-Aware Synthetic Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20670v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00700v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets (rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to publicly available codes is added</p></details> |

We introduce SPEC, a structured, parameterized, hierarchical intermediate representation that exposes UI elements as controllable parameters. Building on SPEC, we present SpecifyUI, an interactive system that extracts SPEC from UI references via region segmentation and vision-language models, composes UIs across multiple sources, and supports targeted edits at global, regional, and component levels. A multi-agent generator renders SPEC into high-fidelity designs, closing the loop between intent expression and controllable generation. Quantitative experiments show SPEC-based generation more faithfully captures reference intent than prompt-based baselines. In a user study with 16 professional designers, SpecifyUI significantly outperformed Stitch on intent alignment, design quality, controllability, and overall experience in human-AI co-creation. Our results position SPEC as a specification-driven paradigm that shifts LLM-assisted design from one-shot prompting to iterative, collaborative workflows.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |

In this study, we propose a prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with SAM2 (Segment Anything Model2) to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse, and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on code.sonography.ai after acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning.

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |

Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions--even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; ICLR 2025 World Models Workshop (oral, outstanding paper award)</p></details> |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14222v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v8)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BriLLM, a brain-inspired large language model that fundamentally redefines the foundations of machine learning through its implementation of Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) learning. This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift.

| **[MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC 2025); Code available at: https://github.com/swsychen/Offline_vs_Online_in_MBRL</p></details> |

However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025. This is the camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated, explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum, dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 6 pages, presented at CHI 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccTENS: 3D Occupancy World Model via Temporal Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03887v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.</p></details> |  |

No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</p></details> | <details><summary>Persp...</summary><p>Perspective paper for a broader scientific audience.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context.

Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability, despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing approaches.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples, such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</p></details> |  |

While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled World Models: Learning to Transfer Semantic Knowledge from Distracting Videos for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08751v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, $\textit{i.e.,}$ RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentangled representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination in Contextual World Models for Zero-Shot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20294v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |
| **[Tracking World States with Language Models: State-Based Evaluation Using Chess](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19851v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities in structured domains, suggesting they may implicitly internalize high-fidelity representations of world models. While probing techniques have shown promising signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and generalizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve the semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity between predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more meaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental results demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking, highlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over long sequences. Our framework provides a robust tool for evaluating structured reasoning in LLMs without requiring internal model access, and generalizes to a wide class of symbolic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight presentation at ICML 2025 Workshop on Assessing World Models</p></details> |

While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/pokerme7777/Compositional-Visual-Reasoning-Survey</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Sample Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning through the Integration of Diffusion Models and Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01427v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO are attractive for continuous control but suffer from poor sample efficiency in costly, high dimensional settings. We present a strictly on policy framework that treats a conditional diffusion model as an adaptable action prior rather than a policy or world model. The prior is pre trained on logged data and used online only at sampling time to propose actions at current on policy states. Two lightweight mechanisms - value guided proposal generation (energy re weighting and in process gradient guidance) and a soft prior KL - regularize the actor via a small auxiliary imitation loss while keeping all PPO updates strictly on on-policy rollouts. To adapt the prior without heavy compute, we apply parameter efficient tuning (PET) that updates only adapters/LoRA, yielding a dual proximal view: policy KL is constrained by PPO and prior KL by PET. Across eight MuJoCo tasks under a shared 1.0M step budget, our method improves early learning (ALC@40) in 3/4 settings and matches or exceeds final return on 6/8 tasks with only 15-30% wall clock overhead. Ablations show that freezing the prior degrades performance and removing value guidance slows early learning; t SNE analyses confirm that value guidance concentrates proposals in high Q regions. Results indicate that an adaptable diffusion action prior is a practical way to boost on policy PPO under tight interaction budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowVLA: Thinking in Motion with a Visual Chain of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$). This paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \textbf{conflates} the task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static appearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling often leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by compelling the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame's \textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this principle by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction. By forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns disentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and significantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited. In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We prompt LMs to generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1 o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC 2...</summary><p>RLC 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.
