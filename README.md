| **[NoRD: A Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model that Drives without Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21172v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with \modelname (\textbf{No} \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{D}riving). Compared to existing VLAs, \modelname achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on $<$60\% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3$\times$ fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. \modelname overcomes this by incorporating Dr.~GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, \modelname achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[ActionReasoning: Robot Action Reasoning in 3D Space with LLM for Robotic Brick Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21161v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical robotic systems typically rely on custom planners designed for constrained environments. While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |
| **[HALO: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Embodied Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21157v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation, but often struggle in long-horizon or out-of-distribution scenarios due to the lack of explicit mechanisms for multimodal reasoning and anticipating how the world will evolve under action. Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Notes-to-Self: Scratchpad Augmented VLAs for Memory Dependent Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21013v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many dexterous manipulation tasks are non-markovian in nature, yet little attention has been paid to this fact in the recent upsurge of the vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. Although they are successful in bringing internet-scale semantic understanding to robotics, existing VLAs are primarily "stateless" and struggle with memory-dependent long horizon tasks. In this work, we explore a way to impart both spatial and temporal memory to a VLA by incorporating a language scratchpad. The scratchpad makes it possible to memorize task-specific information, such as object positions, and it allows the model to keep track of a plan and progress towards subgoals within that plan. We evaluate this approach on a split of memory-dependent tasks from the ClevrSkills environment, on MemoryBench, as well as on a challenging real-world pick-and-place task. We show that incorporating a language scratchpad significantly improves generalization on these tasks for both non-recurrent and recurrent models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fast-ThinkAct: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Verbalizable Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09708v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026.

| **[IG-RFT: An Interaction-Guided RL Framework for VLA Models in Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20715v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential for generalist robotic policies; however, they struggle to generalize to long-horizon complex tasks in novel real-world domains due to distribution shifts and the scarcity of high-quality demonstrations. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037v4)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision-Language-Actionf(VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust BYOVLA that requires external LLMs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. On the real-world FR5 robot, under four types of multimodal perturbations, RobustVLA shows strong low-data performance, outperforming pi0 by 65.6% success rate with 25 demonstrations. Even with abundant demos, our method still outperform pi0 by 30% success rate. Code and demo videos available at https://github.com/gakakulicc/RobustVLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Explainable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20577v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An interactive enhanced driving dataset for autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20575v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of autonomous driving towards full automation demands robust interactive capabilities; however, the development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is constrained by the sparsity of interactive scenarios and inadequate multimodal alignment in existing data. To this end, this paper proposes the Interactive Enhanced Driving Dataset (IEDD). We develop a scalable pipeline to mine million-level interactive segments from naturalistic driving data based on interactive trajectories, and design metrics to quantify the interaction processes. Furthermore, the IEDD-VQA dataset is constructed by generating synthetic Bird's Eye View (BEV) videos where semantic actions are strictly aligned with structured language. Benchmark results evaluating ten mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs) are provided to demonstrate the dataset's reuse value in assessing and fine-tuning the reasoning capabilities of autonomous driving models.</p></details> |  |
| **[BFA++: Hierarchical Best-Feature-Aware Token Prune for Multi-View Vision Language Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20566v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to jointly interpret instructions and visual inputs. However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the π0 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[QuantVLA: Scale-Calibrated Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20309v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models unify perception, language, and control for embodied agents but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to rapidly increasing compute and memory demands, especially as models scale to longer horizons and larger backbones. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniLACT: Depth-Aware RGB Latent Action Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20231v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent action representations learned from unlabeled videos have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for pretraining vision-language-action (VLA) models without explicit robot action supervision. However, latent actions derived solely from RGB observations primarily encode appearance-driven dynamics and lack explicit 3D geometric structure, which is essential for precise and contact-rich manipulation. To address this limitation, we introduce UniLACT, a transformer-based VLA model that incorporates geometric structure through depth-aware latent pretraining, enabling downstream policies to inherit stronger spatial priors. To facilitate this process, we propose UniLARN, a unified latent action learning framework based on inverse and forward dynamics objectives that learns a shared embedding space for RGB and depth while explicitly modeling their cross-modal interactions. This formulation produces modality-specific and unified latent action representations that serve as pseudo-labels for the depth-aware pretraining of UniLACT. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-aware unified latent action representations. UniLACT consistently outperforms RGB-based latent action baselines under in-domain and out-of-domain pretraining regimes, as well as on both seen and unseen manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manishgovind.github.io/unilact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Universal Pose Pretraining for Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19710v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns. To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALOE: Action-Level Off-Policy Evaluation for Vision-Language-Action Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12691v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training. Videos and additional materials are available at our project website.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mantis: A Versatile Vision-Language-Action Model with Disentangled Visual Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16175v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.</p></details> |  |
| **[TwinVLA: Data-Efficient Bimanual Manipulation with Twin Single-Arm Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05275v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data, TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to state-of-the-art model $π_0$, which relies on extensive proprietary bimanual data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 (Poster).

| **[TOPReward: Token Probabilities as Hidden Zero-Shot Rewards for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19313v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Price Is Not Right: Neuro-Symbolic Methods Outperform VLAs on Structured Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks with Significantly Lower Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19260v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently been proposed as a pathway toward generalist robotic policies capable of interpreting natural language and visual inputs to generate manipulation actions. However, their effectiveness and efficiency on structured, long-horizon manipulation tasks remain unclear. In this work, we present a head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model π0 and a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control. We evaluate both approaches on structured variants of the Towers of Hanoi manipulation task in simulation while measuring both task performance and energy consumption during training and execution. On the 3-block task, the neuro-symbolic model achieves 95% success compared to 34% for the best-performing VLA. The neuro-symbolic model also generalizes to an unseen 4-block variant (78% success), whereas both VLAs fail to complete the task. During training, VLA fine-tuning consumes nearly two orders of magnitude more energy than the neuro-symbolic approach. These results highlight important trade-offs between end-to-end foundation-model approaches and structured reasoning architectures for long-horizon robotic manipulation, emphasizing the role of explicit symbolic structure in improving reliability, data efficiency, and energy efficiency.

| **[Global Prior Meets Local Consistency: Dual-Memory Augmented Vision-Language-Action Model for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20200v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have rapidly become a dominant paradigm for robotic manipulation. It typically comprising a Vision-Language backbone for perception and understanding, together with a generative policy for action generation. However, its performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the action generation proceess. (i) Low inference efficiency. A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard. In Real-World evaluation, OptimusVLA ranks best on Generalization and Long-horizon suites, surpassing pi_0 by 42.9% and 52.4%, respectively, while delivering 2.9x inference speedup.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Habilis-$β$: A Fast-Motion and Long-Lasting On-Device Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18813v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Habilis-$β$, a fast-motion and long-lasting on-device vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for real-world deployment. Current VLA evaluation remains largely confined to single-trial success rates under curated resets, which fails to capture the fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities essential for practical operation. To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, Habilis-$β$ achieves 572.6 TPH and 39.2 s MTBI (vs. 120.5 TPH and 30.5 s for $π_{0.5}$), while in a real-world humanoid logistics workflow it achieves 124 TPH and 137.4 s MTBI (vs. 19 TPH and 46.1 s for $π_{0.5}$). Finally, Habilis-$β$ achieves the highest reported performance on the standard RoboTwin 2.0 leaderboard across representative tasks, validating its effectiveness in complex manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Demystifying VLA Inference Performance with VLA-Perf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18397v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems.</p></details> |  |

The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations.

Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, Project Page: https://dravenalg.github.io/VLANeXt/</p></details> |

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as "key-value memory", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, naïve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models. The code and model weights can be found at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/ROCKET-VLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Vision Overrides Language: Evaluating and Mitigating Counterfactual Failures in VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17659v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-va.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EgoScale: Scaling Dexterous Manipulation with Diverse Egocentric Human Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16710v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation, attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits its applicability in real-time robotic systems. Existing approaches accelerate sampling in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting techniques originally developed to speed up image generation. However, a major distinction exists: image generation typically produces independent samples without temporal dependencies, while robotic manipulation requires generating action trajectories with continuity and temporal coherence. To this end, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. Concretely, we introduce a frequency consistency constraint objective that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on 40 tasks of LIBERO. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency of 93.5 Hz.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap." We first characterize the test-time scaling laws for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce CoVer-VLA, a hierarchical test-time verification pipeline using the trained verifier. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses the verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer-VLA achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dreamzero0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Selective Perception for Robot: Task-Aware Attention in Multimodal VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15543v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $π_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to reflect the final accepted version published in Neurocomputing</p></details> |
| **[ActionCodec: What Makes for Good Action Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15397v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $π_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $π_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://lap-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors. To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments.

| **[HBVLA: Pushing 1-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13710v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://huajian-zeng.github.io/projects/flowhoi/</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Steerable Vision-Language-Action Policies for Embodied Reasoning and Hierarchical Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13193v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lyfeng001.github.io/Legato/</p></details> |

Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot. We train policies for 15 minutes on a single RTX 3090 GPU, with most tasks converging in under 6 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>For w...</summary><p>For website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/squint</p></details> |

While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted by the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

In EDID, robots are allowed to exchange information only upon meeting. Crucially, EDID assumes that the robots are not allowed to schedule their meetings. As such, the robots have no means to anticipate when, where, and who they will meet. As a step towards the design of storage and routing algorithms for EDID, in this paper we propose a model of information diffusion that captures the essential dynamics of EDID. The model is derived from first principles and is composed of two levels: a micro model, based on a generalization of the concept of `mean free path'; and a macro model, which captures the global dynamics of information diffusion. We validate the model through extensive robot simulations, in which we consider swarm size, communication range, environment size, and different random motion regimes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this model on the algorithms that best support information diffusion according to the parameters of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published at ANTS 2026</p></details> |

Systematic scanning is difficult due to time-consuming per-sample testing and the high-dimensional parameter space affecting performance. To address this, we propose an optimization pipeline enabled by a novel testing robot capable of scanning DEA lifetime. The robot integrates electro-mechanical property measurement, programmable voltage input, and multi-channel testing capacity. Using it, we scanned the lifetime of Elastosil-based linear actuators across parameters including input voltage magnitude, frequency, electrode material concentration, and electrical connection filler. The optimal parameter combinations improved operational lifetime under boundary operating conditions by up to 100% and were subsequently scaled up to achieve higher force and displacement output. The final product demonstrated resilience on a modular, scalable quadruped walking robot with payload carrying capacity (>100% of its untethered body weight, and >700% of combined actuator weight). This work is the first to introduce a self-driving lab approach into robotic actuator design.</p></details> |  |

We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer that captures contact deformations optically, turning foot-ground interactions into rich haptic signals. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose (position and orientation), visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of the contact patch. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. These findings suggest that integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

Existing methods, employ a variety of open-loop and closed-loop approaches but lack an end-to-end solution that can grasp several objects while taking into account the downstream task's constraints. Our proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance task-oriented grasping, prioritizing the post-grasp intention of the agent. We extract human grasp preferences from the ContactPose dataset, and train a hand synergy model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to imitate the participant's grasping actions. Based on this data, we train an agent able to grasp multiple objects while taking into account distinct post-grasp intentions that are task-specific. By combining data-driven insights from human grasping behavior with learning by exploration provided by reinforcement learning, we can develop humanoid robots capable of context-aware manipulation actions, facilitating collaboration in human-centered environments.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods are severely limited by treating each transfer as an isolated endeavor, demanding repeated, costly tuning and wasting prior transfer experience.To move beyond isolated sim-to-real, we build a continual cross-task sim-to-real transfer paradigm centered on knowledge accumulation across iterative transfers, thereby enabling effective and efficient adaptation to novel tasks. Thus, we propose GeCo-SRT, a geometry-aware continual adaptation method. It utilizes domain-invariant and task-invariant knowledge from local geometric features as a transferable foundation to accelerate adaptation during subsequent sim-to-real transfers. This method starts with a geometry-aware mixture-of-experts module, which dynamically activates experts to specialize in distinct geometric knowledge to bridge observation sim-to-real gap. Further, the geometry-expert-guided prioritized experience replay module preferentially samples from underutilized experts, refreshing specialized knowledge to combat forgetting and maintain robust cross-task performance. Leveraging knowledge accumulated during iterative transfer, GeCo-SRT method not only achieves 52% average performance improvement over the baseline, but also demonstrates significant data efficiency for new task adaptation with only 1/6 data.We hope this work inspires approaches for efficient, low-cost cross-task sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CVPR 2026</p></details> |

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for advancing robotic capabilities in dynamic environments. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories under complex dynamics, and it necessitates intelligent control strategies to ensure precise ball striking to target regions. High-speed object manipulation typically demands advanced visual perception hardware capable of capturing rapid motion with exceptional temporal resolution. Drawing inspiration from Kahneman's dual-system theory, where fast intuitive processing complements slower deliberate reasoning, there exists an opportunity to develop more robust perception architectures that can handle high-speed dynamics while maintaining accuracy. To this end, we present \textit{\textbf{SpikePingpong}}, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. We develop a Fast-Slow system architecture where System 1 provides rapid ball detection and preliminary trajectory prediction with millisecond-level responses, while System 2 employs spike-oriented neural calibration for precise hittable position corrections. For strategic ball striking, we introduce Imitation-based Motion Planning And Control Technology, which learns optimal robotic arm striking policies through demonstration-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{\textbf{SpikePingpong}} achieves a remarkable 92\% success rate for 30 cm accuracy zones and 70\% in the more challenging 20 cm precision targeting. This work demonstrates the potential of Fast-Slow architectures for advancing robotic capabilities in time-critical manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we aim to develop a system that can recognize its surroundings and identify target objects while in motion, enabling it to plan and execute actions accordingly. We propose a periodic sampling-based whole-body trajectory planning method, called the "Robot Local Planner (RLP)." This method leverages unique features of home environments to enhance computational efficiency, motion optimality, and robustness against recognition and control errors, all while ensuring safety. The RLP minimizes computation time by planning with minimal waypoints and generating safe trajectories. Furthermore, overall motion optimality is improved by periodically executing trajectory planning to select more optimal motions. This approach incorporates inverse kinematics that are robust to base position errors, further enhancing robustness. Evaluation experiments demonstrated that the RLP outperformed existing methods in terms of motion planning time, motion duration, and robustness, confirming its effectiveness in home environments.

In contrast, robotic grinding systems typically rely on force sensing, with acoustic information largely ignored. This reliance on force sensors is costly and difficult to adapt to different grinding tools, whereas audio sensors (microphones) are low-cost and can be mounted on any medium that conducts grinding sound. This paper introduces a low-cost Acoustic Feedback Robotic Grinding System (AFRG) that captures audio signals with a contact microphone, estimates grinding force from the audio in real time, and enables closed-loop force control of the grinding process. Compared with conventional force-sensing approaches, AFRG achieves a 4-fold improvement in consistency across different grinding disc conditions. AFRG relies solely on a low-cost microphone, which is approximately 200-fold cheaper than conventional force sensors, as the sensing modality, providing an easily deployable, cost-effective robotic grinding solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026. 8 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating semantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

These robots often incorporate deep learning (DL) components into their software to support functionality such as perception, decision-making, and control, enhancing autonomy and self-adaptability. However, the inherent uncertainty of DL-enabled software makes it challenging to ensure its dependability in dynamic environments. Consequently, test generation techniques have been developed to test robot software, and classical mutation analysis injects faults into the software to assess the test suite's effectiveness in detecting the resulting failures. However, there is a lack of mutation analysis techniques to assess the effectiveness under the uncertainty inherent to DL-enabled software. To this end, we propose UAMTERS, an uncertainty-aware mutation analysis framework that introduces uncertainty-aware mutation operators to explicitly inject stochastic uncertainty into DL-enabled robotic software, simulating uncertainty in its behavior. We further propose mutation score metrics to quantify a test suite's ability to detect failures under varying levels of uncertainty. We evaluate UAMTERS across three robotic case studies, demonstrating that UAMTERS more effectively distinguishes test suite quality and captures uncertainty-induced failures in DL-enabled software.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Continuum Robot State Estimation with Actuation Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04493v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuum robots are flexible, thin manipulators capable of navigating confined or delicate environments making them well suited for surgical applications. Previous approaches to continuum robot state estimation typically rely on simplified, deterministic actuation models. In contrast, our method jointly estimates robot shape, external loads, internal stresses, and actuation inputs. We adopt a discrete Cosserat rod formulation and show that, when paired with a midpoint integration rule, it achieves high numerical accuracy with relatively few state nodes. This discretization naturally induces a factor-graph structure for sparse nonlinear optimization on SE(3). We extend the formulation with actuation factors for tendon-driven robots and combine multiple rod graphs for parallel continuum robots with closed-loop topologies. By explicitly including actuation variables in the state, the linearized system can be reused to extract manipulator Jacobians, which we leverage in performing trajectory tracking. Finally, we validate the approach experimentally on a surgical concentric tube robot. Overall, our approach enables principled, real-time estimation across multiple continuum robot architectures, accounting for actuation uncertainty and providing direct access to manipulator Jacobians.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Public preprint for IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://AdaWorldPolicy.github.io</p></details> |

Unlike rigid wings, deformable counterparts can alter their aerodynamic properties on demand. Improvements in hydrodynamic efficiency extend a UUV's operational range and may determine mission feasibility. Structural and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for both a soft morphing wing and a UUV incorporating it. The results show that a UUV employing soft wings achieves 9.75 percent higher overall efficiency than an equivalent vehicle with traditional rigid wings.

| **[Memory-Efficient 2D/3D Shape Assembly of Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26518v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as a representative class of methods for robot swarm shape assembly. They rely on image-based target-shape representations to compute local density gradients and perform mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such representations incur substantial memory overhead, especially for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient tree representation that hierarchically encodes user-specified shapes in both 2D and 3D. Based on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller for assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm show one to two orders of magnitude lower memory usage and two to four times faster shape entry. Physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs further validate real-world practicality.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a brain-robot control framework for offline decoding of driving commands during robotic rover operation. A 4WD Rover Pro platform was remotely operated by 12 participants who navigated a predefined route using a joystick, executing the commands forward, reverse, left, right, and stop. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded with a 16-channel OpenBCI cap and aligned with motor actions at Delta = 0 ms and future prediction horizons (Delta > 0 ms). After preprocessing, several deep learning models were benchmarked, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer architectures. ShallowConvNet achieved the highest performance for both action prediction and intent prediction. By combining real-world robotic control with multi-horizon EEG intention decoding, this study introduces a reproducible benchmark and reveals key design insights for predictive deep learning-based BCI systems.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory representations are parameterized as linear combinations of orthogonal basis functions, and optimization is performed directly in the coefficient space. The constrained problem formulation consists of both an objective functional and a finite-dimensional objective defined over truncated coefficients. To address nonlinearity, FACTO uses a Gauss-Newton approximation with exponential moving averaging, yielding a smoothed quadratic subproblem. Trajectory-wide constraints are addressed using coefficient-space mappings, and an adaptive constrained update using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is performed in the null space of active constraints. Comparisons with optimization-based planners (CHOMP, TrajOpt, GPMP2) and sampling-based planners (RRT-Connect, RRT*, PRM) show the improved solution quality and feasibility, especially in constrained single- and multi-arm scenarios. The experimental evaluation of FACTO on Franka robots verifies the feasibility of deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Safety Reasoning and Grounding for Open-World Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19983v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly operating in open-world environments where safe behavior depends on context: the same hallway may require different navigation strategies when crowded versus empty, or during an emergency versus normal operations. Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

| **[Much Ado About Noising: Dispelling the Myths of Generative Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01809v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding, each with multi-modal time series data and several anomalies. Several autoencoderbased methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different robotic tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, the paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles. The manipulator with a maximum reach of 1.54m can be used to operate doors, valves, and other objects of interest. Full CAD & PCB files, as well as all low-level software, are released as open-source contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/athena</p></details> |

A key challenge lies in achieving reliable autonomous in-motion physical coupling of two mobile ground robots starting at any initial position. Existing approaches neglect the modeling of the docking interface and the strategy for approaching it, resulting in uncontrolled collisions that make in-motion physical coupling either impossible or inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose a central mpc approach that explicitly models the dynamics and states of two omnidirectional wheeled robots, incorporates constraints related to their docking interface, and implements an approaching strategy for rendezvous and docking. This novel approach enables omnidirectional wheeled robots with a docking interface to physically couple in motion regardless of their initial position. In addition, it makes in-motion transfer possible, which is 19.75% more time- and 21.04% energy-efficient compared to a non-coupling approach in a logistic scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, conference paper</p></details> |

While vision-based soft tactile sensors can track internal marker displacements, learning-based models for 3D contact estimation heavily depend on their training datasets, inherently limiting their ability to generalize to complex scenarios such as multi-point sensing. To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm. By successfully extrapolating complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, this methodology unlocks advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Ultimately, it significantly streamlines the development of marker-based soft sensors, offering a highly scalable solution for real-world tactile perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted at 9th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |

Experimental evaluations conducted on consumer-grade hardware demonstrate a command execution accuracy of 75\%, highlighting both the robustness and adaptability of the system.

In this paper, we aim for efficient and effective multi-robot decision-making despite the robots' limited on-board resources and the often resource-demanding complexity of their tasks. We introduce the first algorithm enabling the robots to choose with which few other robots to coordinate and provably balance the trade-off of centralized vs. decentralized coordination. Particularly, centralization favors globally near-optimal decision-making but at the cost of increased on-board resource requirements; whereas, decentralization favors minimal resource requirements but at a global suboptimality cost. All robots can thus afford our algorithm, irrespective of their resources. We are motivated by the future of autonomy that involves multiple robots coordinating actions to complete resource-demanding tasks, such as target tracking, area coverage, and monitoring. To provide closed-form guarantees, we focus on maximization problems involving monotone and 2nd-order submodular functions. To capture the cost of decentralization, we introduce the notion of Centralization Of Information among non-Neighbors (COIN). We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of image covering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated presentation.

Unlike physicians, who can directly manipulate guidewires and integrate tactile feedback with their prior anatomical knowledge, teleoperated robotic systems must rely solely on 2D projections. This mode of operation, simultaneously lacking spatial context and tactile sensation, may give rise to projection-induced ambiguities at vascular bifurcations. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework (SCAR-UNet-GAT) for real-time robotic path planning. In the first stage, SCAR-UNet, a spatial-coordinate-attention-regularized U-Net, is employed for accurate coronary vessel segmentation. The integration of multi-level attention mechanisms enhances the delineation of thin, tortuous vessels and improves robustness against imaging noise. From the resulting binary masks, vessel centerlines and bifurcation points are extracted, and geometric descriptors (e.g., branch diameter, intersection angles) are fused with local DSA patches to construct node features. In the second stage, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) reasons over the vessel graph to identify anatomically consistent and clinically feasible trajectories, effectively distinguishing true bifurcations from projection-induced false crossings. On a clinical DSA dataset, SCAR-UNet achieved a Dice coefficient of 93.1%. For path disambiguation, the proposed GAT-based method attained a success rate of 95.0% and a target-arrival success rate of 90.0%, substantially outperforming conventional shortest-path planning (60.0% and 55.0%) and heuristic-based planning (75.0% and 70.0%).

A design agent and control agent engage in a thesis-antithesis-synthesis loop, while pluralistic LLM judges provide multi-objective feedback to steer exploration. Across five MuJoCo locomotion benchmarks, D2C achieves up to $3.2\times$ the default Ant score and $\sim9\times$ on Swimmer, outperforming prior LLM-based methods and black-box optimization. Iterative debate yields 18--35% gains over compute-matched zero-shot generation, and D2C-generated rewards transfer to default morphologies in 4/5 tasks. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate offers an effective alternative to hand-designed objectives for joint morphology-reward optimization.</p></details> |  |

Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Shape Control of Extensible Multi-Section Soft Continuum Robots via Visual Servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19273v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based control algorithm for regulating the whole body shape of extensible multisection soft continuum manipulators. Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm. Proof-of-concept object manipulation experiments including stacking, pouring, and pulling tasks are performed to demonstrate our controller's applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Prior Meets Local Consistency: Dual-Memory Augmented Vision-Language-Action Model for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20200v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have rapidly become a dominant paradigm for robotic manipulation. It typically comprising a Vision-Language backbone for perception and understanding, together with a generative policy for action generation. However, its performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the action generation proceess. (i) Low inference efficiency. A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard.

Recent approaches attempt to extract manipulation commands directly from video demonstrations, yet face two critical challenges: (1) general video captioning models prioritize global scene features over task-relevant objects, producing descriptions unsuitable for precise robotic execution, and (2) end-to-end architectures coupling visual understanding with policy learning require extensive paired datasets and struggle to generalize across objects and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations. We validated our approach in PyBullet simulation environments with a UR5e manipulator and in a real-world experiment with a UF850 manipulator across four fundamental actions: reach, pick, move, and put. For video understanding, our method achieves 89.97% action classification accuracy and BLEU-4 scores of 0.351 on standard objects and 0.265 on novel objects, representing improvements of 76.4% and 128.4% over the best baseline, respectively. For robot manipulation, our framework achieves an average success rate of 87.5% across all actions, with 100% success on reaching tasks and up to 90% on complex pick-and-place operations.

| **[Distributed and Consistent Multi-Robot Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry on Lie Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19173v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable localization is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Fire Through Thermal Radiation Fields for Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19108v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safely moving through environments affected by fire is a critical capability for autonomous mobile robots deployed in disaster response. In this work, we present a novel approach for mobile robots to understand fire through building real-time thermal radiation fields. We register depth and thermal images to obtain a 3D point cloud annotated with temperature values. From these data, we identify fires and use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to approximate the thermal radiation in empty spaces. This enables the construction of a continuous thermal radiation field over the environment. We show that this representation can be used for robot navigation, where we embed thermal constraints into the cost map to compute collision-free and thermally safe paths. We validate our approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in controlled experimental settings. Our experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to avoid hazardous regions while still reaching navigation goals. Our approach paves the way toward mobile robots that can be autonomously deployed in fire-affected environments, with potential applications in search-and-rescue, firefighting, and hazardous material response.</p></details> |  |

This creates a high barrier of entry and results in repetition of avoidable mistakes. To articulate the tacit knowledge in the HRI community, this paper presents a guideline in the form of a checklist to support researchers in preparing for robot deployments in public. Drawing on their own experience with public robot deployments, the research team collected essential topics to consider in public HRI research. These topics are represented as modular flip cards in a hierarchical table, structured into deployment phases and important domains. We interviewed six interdisciplinary researchers with expertise in public HRI and show how including community input refines the checklist. We further show the checklist in action in context of real public studies. Finally, we contribute the checklist as an open-source, customizable community resource that both collects joint expertise for continual evolution and is usable as a list, set of cards, and an interactive web tool.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present TactEx, an explainable multimodal robotic interaction framework that unifies vision, touch, and language for human-like hardness estimation and interactive guidance. We evaluate TactEx on fruit-ripeness assessment, a representative task that requires both tactile sensing and contextual understanding. The system fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts. A ResNet50+LSTM model estimates hardness from sequential tactile data, while a cross-modal alignment module combines visual cues with guidance from a large language model (LLM). This explainable multimodal interface allows users to distinguish ripeness levels with statistically significant class separation (p < 0.01 for all fruit pairs). For touch placement, we compare YOLO with Grounded-SAM (GSAM) and find GSAM to be more robust for fine-grained segmentation and contact-site selection. A lightweight LLM parses user instructions and produces grounded natural-language explanations linked to the tactile outputs. In end-to-end evaluations, TactEx attains 90% task success on simple user queries and generalises to novel tasks without large-scale tuning. These results highlight the promise of combining pretrained visual and tactile models with language grounding to advance explainable, human-like touch perception and decision-making in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 ICRA</p></details> |

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, The 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |

Robotic automation presents a compelling approach to this challenge by accelerating the sorting process through automated contaminant removal. Still, the diverse and unpredictable nature of contaminants creates major challenges for robotic grasping. Benchmarking frameworks are critical for evaluating challenges from various perspectives. However, existing protocols rely on limited simulation datasets, prioritise simple metrics such as success rate, and overlook key object and environment-related pre-grasp conditions. This paper introduces GRAB, a comprehensive Grasping Real-World Article Benchmarking framework that addresses this gap by integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision, and, importantly, pre-grasp conditions, establishing a set of critical graspability metrics. It systematically compares industrial grasping modalities through an in-depth experimental evaluation involving 1,750 food contaminant grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes. This large-scale evaluation provides an extensive assessment of grasp performance for food waste sorting, offering a level of depth that has rarely been explored in previous studies. The results reveal distinct gripper strengths and limitations, with object quality emerging as the dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels play moderate roles. These findings highlight essential design considerations and reinforce the necessity of developing multimodal gripper technologies capable of robust cross-category performance for effective robotic food waste sorting.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 12 Figures, 3 Tables, submitted to Advanced Intelligent Systems Journal and under review</p></details> |

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have been leveraged to validate video quality, but they have limitations in distinguishing physically accurate videos and, even then, cannot directly evaluate the generated actions themselves. To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages; 6 figures; Project page is available at https://seungkukim.github.io/robocurate/</p></details> |

However, even augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy, trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel instructions and environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

| **[Spa3R: Predictive Spatial Field Modeling for 3D Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21186v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R.</p></details> |  |

Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |
| **[VAUQ: Vision-Aware Uncertainty Quantification for LVLM Self-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21054v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently hallucinate, limiting their safe deployment in real-world applications. Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR-Agent: Agentic OCR with Capability and Memory Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21053v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential on complex visual understanding tasks through iterative optimization methods.However, these models generally lack effective self-correction mechanisms, making it difficult for them to independently rectify cognitive biases. Consequently, during multi-turn revisions, they often fall into repetitive and ineffective attempts, failing to achieve stable improvements in answer quality.To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative self-correction framework that endows models with two key capabilities: Capability Reflection and Memory Reflection. This framework guides the model to first diagnose errors and generate a correction plan via Capability Reflection, then leverage Memory Reflection to review past attempts to avoid repetition and explore new solutions, and finally, optimize the answer through rigorous re-reasoning. Experiments on the challenging OCRBench v2 benchmark show that OCR-Agent outperforms the current open-source SOTA model InternVL3-8B by +2.0 on English and +1.2 on Chinese subsets, while achieving state-of-the-art results in Visual Understanding (79.9) and Reasoning (66.5) - surpassing even larger fine-tuned models. Our method demonstrates that structured, self-aware reflection can significantly enhance VLMs' reasoning robustness without additional training.

Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models.

Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches. Experiments show that CLIP equipped with CLIPGlasses achieves competitive in-domain performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain generalization. Its superiority is especially evident under low-resource conditions, indicating stronger robustness across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Perception to Action: An Interactive Benchmark for Vision Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21015v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical structure is essential for real-world applications such as embodied agents, interactive design, and long-horizon manipulation. Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

Existing evaluations primarily assess the correctness of the answers, making it unclear whether failures arise from limited reasoning capability or from misidentifying causally relevant information. We introduce Vision-Language Causal Graphs (VLCGs), a structured, query-conditioned representation that explicitly encodes causally relevant objects, attributes, relations, and scene-grounded assumptions. Building on this representation, we present ViLCaR, a diagnostic benchmark comprising tasks for Causal Attribution, Causal Inference, and Question Answering, along with graph-aligned evaluation metrics that assess relevance identification beyond final answer accuracy. Experiments in state-of-the-art LVLMs show that injecting structured relevance information significantly improves attribution and inference consistency compared to zero-shot and standard in-context learning. These findings suggest that current limitations in LVLM causal reasoning stem primarily from insufficient structural guidance rather than a lack of reasoning capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUSE: Harnessing Precise and Diverse Semantics for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20873v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, few-shot whole slide image classification is primarily driven by the extreme scarcity of expert-labeled slides. Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization.

In so doing, they enable a wide range of multimodal tasks, while also raising critical questions about the nature of machine 'understanding.' In this paper, we examine how Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods can render the visual reasoning of a VLM - namely, CLIP - legible in art-historical contexts. To this end, we evaluate seven methods, combining zero-shot localization experiments with human interpretability studies. Our results indicate that, while these methods capture some aspects of human interpretation, their effectiveness hinges on the conceptual stability and representational availability of the examined categories.</p></details> |  |

We propose GatedCLIP, a Vision-Language model that enhances CLIP's multimodal capabilities with specialized architectural improvements for hateful memes detection. Our approach introduces learned projection heads that map CLIP embeddings to a task-optimized semantic space, a dynamic gated fusion mechanism that adaptively weights visual and textual features, and a contrastive learning objective that maintains cross-modal semantic alignment. Experiments on the Hateful Memes dataset demonstrate that GatedCLIP achieves an AUROC of 0.66, substantially outperforming the CLIP baseline (AUROC 0.49) while maintaining computational efficiency with only 350K trainable parameters.</p></details> | Preprint |

While some promising approaches attempt to mitigate this by constructing Q&A data for auxiliary training, they still fail to fundamentally equip VLMs with the ability to comprehensively handle diverse evaluation protocols. We thus chart a new course, advocating for the infusion of VLMs with the cross-view geometric grounding of mature 3D foundation models, closing this critical capability gap in autonomous driving. In this spirit, we propose a novel architecture, VGGDrive, which empowers Vision-language models with cross-view Geometric Grounding for autonomous Driving. Concretely, to bridge the cross-view 3D geometric features from the frozen visual 3D model with the VLM's 2D visual features, we introduce a plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE). The CVGE decouples the base VLM architecture and effectively empowers the VLM with 3D features through a hierarchical adaptive injection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that VGGDrive enhances base VLM performance across five autonomous driving benchmarks, including tasks like cross-view risk perception, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. It's our belief that mature 3D foundation models can empower autonomous driving tasks through effective integration, and we hope our initial exploration demonstrates the potential of this paradigm to the autonomous driving community.</p></details> | CVPR 2026 |

While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRROR: Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection on Visual Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18746v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.</p></details> |  |
| **[NGL-Prompter: Training-Free Sewing Pattern Estimation from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20700v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating sewing patterns from images is a practical approach for creating high-quality 3D garments. Due to the lack of real-world pattern-image paired data, prior approaches fine-tune large vision language models (VLMs) on synthetic garment datasets generated by randomly sampling from a parametric garment model GarmentCode. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to in-the-wild images, fail to capture real-world correlations between garment parts, and are typically restricted to single-layer outfits. In contrast, we observe that VLMs are effective at describing garments in natural language, yet perform poorly when asked to directly regress GarmentCode parameters from images. To bridge this gap, we propose NGL (Natural Garment Language), a novel intermediate language that restructures GarmentCode into a representation more understandable to language models. Leveraging this language, we introduce NGL-Prompter, a training-free pipeline that queries large VLMs to extract structured garment parameters, which are then deterministically mapped to valid GarmentCode. We evaluate our method on the Dress4D, CloSe and a newly collected dataset of approximately 5,000 in-the-wild fashion images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard geometry metrics and is strongly preferred in both human and GPT-based perceptual evaluations compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, NGL-prompter can recover multi-layer outfits whereas competing methods focus mostly on single-layer garments, highlighting its strong generalization to real-world images even with occluded parts. These results demonstrate that accurate sewing pattern reconstruction is possible without costly model training. Our code and data will be released for research use.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PromptCD: Test-Time Behavior Enhancement via Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20696v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable AI systems require large language models (LLMs) to exhibit behaviors aligned with human preferences and values. However, most existing alignment approaches operate at training time and rely on additional high-quality data, incurring significant computational and annotation costs. While recent work has shown that contrastive decoding can leverage a model's internal distributions to improve specific capabilities, its applicability remains limited to narrow behavioral scopes and scenarios. In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the "3H" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding. Collectively, these results highlight PromptCD as a simple, general, and cost-efficient strategy for reliable behavior control across modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Foundational Skills Influence VLM-based Embodied Agents:A Native Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20687v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for human-level embodied intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for VLM-driven embodied agents often rely on high-level commands or discretized action spaces, which are non-native settings that differ markedly from real-world control. In addition, current benchmarks focus primarily on high-level tasks and lack joint evaluation and analysis at both low and high levels. To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space. Built on diverse simulated scenes, NativeEmbodied includes three representative high-level tasks in complex scenarios to evaluate overall performance. For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill. This joint evaluation across task and skill granularities enables fine-grained assessment of embodied agents. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal clear deficiencies in several fundamental embodied skills, and further analysis shows that these bottlenecks significantly limit performance on high-level tasks. NativeEmbodied highlights key challenges for current VLM-driven embodied agents and provides insights to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Models for Ergonomic Assessment of Manual Lifting Tasks: Estimating Horizontal and Vertical Hand Distances from RGB Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20658v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual lifting tasks are a major contributor to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and effective ergonomic risk assessment is essential for quantifying physical exposure and informing ergonomic interventions. The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoloLLM: Multisensory Foundation Model for Language-Grounded Human Sensing and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17645v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

| **[Efficient and Explainable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20577v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An interactive enhanced driving dataset for autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20575v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of autonomous driving towards full automation demands robust interactive capabilities; however, the development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is constrained by the sparsity of interactive scenarios and inadequate multimodal alignment in existing data. To this end, this paper proposes the Interactive Enhanced Driving Dataset (IEDD). We develop a scalable pipeline to mine million-level interactive segments from naturalistic driving data based on interactive trajectories, and design metrics to quantify the interaction processes. Furthermore, the IEDD-VQA dataset is constructed by generating synthetic Bird's Eye View (BEV) videos where semantic actions are strictly aligned with structured language. Benchmark results evaluating ten mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs) are provided to demonstrate the dataset's reuse value in assessing and fine-tuning the reasoning capabilities of autonomous driving models.</p></details> |  |
| **[BFA++: Hierarchical Best-Feature-Aware Token Prune for Multi-View Vision Language Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20566v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to jointly interpret instructions and visual inputs. However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the π0 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Beyond Human Performance: A Vision-Language Multi-Agent Approach for Quality Control in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20543v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colony-forming unit (CFU) detection is critical in pharmaceutical manufacturing, serving as a key component of Environmental Monitoring programs and ensuring compliance with stringent quality standards. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al., 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97.08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.6 percent false negatives. Despite high validation accuracy, Detectron2 performance degrades on outlier cases including contaminated plates, plastic artifacts, or poor optical clarity. To address this, we developed a multi-agent framework combining DL with vision-language models (VLMs). The VLM agent first classifies plates as valid or invalid. For valid samples, both DL and VLM agents independently estimate colony counts. When predictions align within 5 percent, results are automatically recorded in Postgres and SAP; otherwise, samples are routed for expert review. Expert feedback enables continuous retraining and self-improvement. Initial DL-based automation reduced human verification by 50 percent across vaccine manufacturing sites. With VLM integration, this increased to 85 percent, delivering significant operational savings. The proposed system provides a scalable, auditable, and regulation-ready solution for microbiological quality control, advancing automation in biopharmaceutical production.</p></details> |  |

We use a two-stage diagnostic setup in which masked image regions are reconstructed and then provided to captioning models, enabling controlled comparisons between captions generated from original and reconstructed inputs. Across multiple datasets, we analyze the relationship between reconstruction fidelity and downstream caption quality. We observe consistent associations between pixel-level and perceptual reconstruction metrics and both lexical and semantic captioning performance. Additional analysis of intermediate visual representations and attention patterns shows that inpainting artifacts lead to systematic, layer-dependent changes in model behavior. Together, these results provide a practical diagnostic framework for examining how visual reconstruction quality influences language generation in multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inner Speech as Behavior Guides: Steerable Imitation of Diverse Behaviors for Human-AI coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20517v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective human-AI coordination requires artificial agents capable of exhibiting and responding to human-like behaviors while adapting to changing contexts. Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.</p></details> |  |

We propose ActionEngine, a training-free framework that transitions from reactive execution to programmatic planning through a novel two-agent architecture: a Crawling Agent that constructs an updatable state-machine memory of the GUIs through offline exploration, and an Execution Agent that leverages this memory to synthesize complete, executable Python programs for online task execution. To ensure robustness against evolving interfaces, execution failures trigger a vision-based re-grounding fallback that repairs the failed action and updates the memory. This design drastically improves both efficiency and accuracy: on Reddit tasks from the WebArena benchmark, our agent achieves 95% task success with on average a single LLM call, compared to 66% for the strongest vision-only baseline, while reducing cost by 11.8x and end-to-end latency by 2x. Together, these components yield scalable and reliable GUI interaction by combining global programmatic planning, crawler-validated action templates, and node-level execution with localized validation and repair.</p></details> |  |

We present a strategy-grounded framework that couples high-level vision-language inference with low-level closed-loop control. Offline, raw surgical videos are parsed into camera-relevant temporal events (e.g., interaction, working-distance deviation, and view-quality degradation) and structured as attributed event graphs. Mining these graphs yields a compact set of reusable camera-handling strategy primitives, which provide structured supervision for learning. Online, a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) processes the live laparoscopic view to predict the dominant strategy and discrete image-based motion commands, executed by an IBVS-RCM controller under strict safety constraints; optional speech input enables intuitive human-in-the-loop conditioning. On a surgeon-annotated dataset, event parsing achieves reliable temporal localization (F1-score 0.86), and the mined strategies show strong semantic alignment with expert interpretation (cluster purity 0.81). Extensive ex vivo experiments on silicone phantoms and porcine tissues demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms junior surgeons in standardized camera-handling evaluations, reducing field-of-view centering error by 35.26% and image shaking by 62.33%, while preserving smooth motion and stable working-distance regulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO). 19 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence.

Extensive experiments across 16 datasets spanning five imaging modalities and six organs demonstrate that MedCLIPSeg outperforms prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps that highlight local reliability of segmentation results.

Yet, these models remain fragile under domain shifts, especially when adapting from synthetic to real-world point clouds. Conventional 3D domain adaptation approaches rely on heavy trainable encoders, yielding strong accuracy but at the cost of efficiency. We introduce CLIPoint3D, the first framework for few-shot unsupervised 3D point cloud domain adaptation built upon CLIP. Our approach projects 3D samples into multiple depth maps and exploits the frozen CLIP backbone, refined through a knowledge-driven prompt tuning scheme that integrates high-level language priors with geometric cues from a lightweight 3D encoder. To adapt task-specific features effectively, we apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning to CLIP's encoders and design an entropy-guided view sampling strategy for selecting confident projections. Furthermore, an optimal transport-based alignment loss and an uncertainty-aware prototype alignment loss collaboratively bridge source-target distribution gaps while maintaining class separability. Extensive experiments on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 benchmarks show that CLIPoint3D achieves consistent 3-16% accuracy gains over both CLIP-based and conventional encoder-based baselines.

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated acknowledgements</p></details> |

| **[Learning Physical Principles from Interaction: Self-Evolving Planning via Test-Time Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20323v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable object manipulation requires understanding physical properties that vary across objects and environments. Vision-language model (VLM) planners can reason about friction and stability in general terms; however, they often cannot predict how a specific ball will roll on a particular surface or which stone will provide a stable foundation without direct experience. We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones. On a controlled brick insertion task, principled abstraction achieves 76% success compared to 23% for direct experience retrieval, and real-world experiments show consistent improvement over 30-minute deployment sessions.</p></details> |  |
| **[De-rendering, Reasoning, and Repairing Charts with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20291v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data visualizations are central to scientific communication, journalism, and everyday decision-making, yet they are frequently prone to errors that can distort interpretation or mislead audiences. Rule-based visualization linters can flag violations, but they miss context and do not suggest meaningful design changes. Directly querying general-purpose LLMs about visualization quality is unreliable: lacking training to follow visualization design principles, they often produce inconsistent or incorrect feedback. In this work, we introduce a framework that combines chart de-rendering, automated analysis, and iterative improvement to deliver actionable, interpretable feedback on visualization design. Our system reconstructs the structure of a chart from an image, identifies design flaws using vision-language reasoning, and proposes concrete modifications supported by established principles in visualization research. Users can selectively apply these improvements and re-render updated figures, creating a feedback loop that promotes both higher-quality visualizations and the development of visualization literacy. In our evaluation on 1,000 charts from the Chart2Code benchmark, the system generated 10,452 design recommendations, which clustered into 10 coherent categories (e.g., axis formatting, color accessibility, legend consistency). These results highlight the promise of LLM-driven recommendation systems for delivering structured, principle-based feedback on visualization design, opening the door to more intelligent and accessible authoring tools.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 38.90 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +13.98 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them "structure-centric". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/intelligolabs/StructXLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Principles?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20084v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Safety Reasoning and Grounding for Open-World Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19983v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly operating in open-world environments where safe behavior depends on context: the same hallway may require different navigation strategies when crowded versus empty, or during an emergency versus normal operations. Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

However, existing deep learning-based beam prediction methods lack high-level semantic understanding of dynamic environments, resulting in poor generalization. On the other hand, the emerging large language model (LLM) based approaches show promise in enhancing generalization, but they typically lack rich environmental perception, thereby failing to capture fine-grained spatial semantics essential for precise beam alignment. To tackle these limitations, we propose in this correspondence a novel end-to-end generative framework for beam prediction, called BeamVLM, which treats beam prediction as a vision question answering task capitalizing on powerful existing vision-language models (VLMs). By projecting raw visual patches directly into the language domain and judiciously designing an instructional prompt, the proposed BeamVLM enables the VLM to jointly reason over UAV trajectories and environmental context. Last, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed BeamVLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and also exhibits superior generalization for other scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) beam prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We propose a novel end-to-end generative framework for beam prediction by using vision-language models</p></details> |

However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models.

Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a novel multimodal HRI framework that combines advanced vision-language models, speech processing, and fuzzy logic to enable precise and adaptive control of a Dobot Magician robotic arm. The proposed system integrates Florence-2 for object detection, Llama 3.1 for natural language understanding, and Whisper for speech recognition, providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface for object manipulation through spoken commands.

Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively.

Unlike prior methods that handle spatial and temporal correlations separately, we propose RAYNOVA, a geometry-free world model that employs a dual-causal autoregressive framework. It follows both scale-wise and temporal topological orders in the autoregressive process, and leverages global attention for unified 4D spatio-temporal reasoning. Different from existing works that impose strong 3D geometric priors, RAYNOVA constructs an isotropic spatio-temporal representation across views, frames, and scales based on relative Plücker-ray positional encoding, enabling robust generalization to diverse camera setups and ego motions. We further introduce a recurrent training paradigm to alleviate distribution drift in long-horizon video generation. RAYNOVA achieves state-of-the-art multi-view video generation results on nuScenes, while offering higher throughput and strong controllability under diverse input conditions, generalizing to novel views and camera configurations without explicit 3D scene representation.

| **[Recursive Belief Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20659v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19698v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark on average. However, we discover that conventional aggregates mask a major problem, Performance Asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in certain tasks (Agent-Optimal tasks) while drastically underperform humans in other tasks (Human-Optimal tasks). Indeed, despite achieving SOTA in the overall mean Human-Normalized Scores (HNS), the SOTA agent scored the worst among baselines on Human-Optimal tasks, with a striking 21X performance gap between the Human-Optimal and Agent-Optimal subsets. To address this, we partition Atari100k evenly into Human-Optimal and Agent-Optimal subsets, and introduce a more balanced aggregate, Sym-HNS. Furthermore, we trace the striking Performance Asymmetry in the SOTA pixel diffusion world model to the curse of dimensionality and its prowess on high visual detail tasks (e.g. Breakout). To this end, we propose a novel latent end-to-end Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI) world model that achieves SOTA results in Sym-HNS, Human-Optimal tasks, and Breakout -- thus reversing the worsening Performance Asymmetry trend while improving computational efficiency and remaining competitive on the full Atari100k.</p></details> | Preprint |

We prove that every forward model in a broad, precisely defined operator class Cimg (encompassing clinical, scientific, and industrial imaging modalities, both linear and nonlinear) admits an epsilon-approximate representation as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are drawn from a library of exactly 11 canonical primitives: Propagate, Modulate, Project, Encode, Convolve, Accumulate, Detect, Sample, Disperse, Scatter, and Transform. We call this the Finite Primitive Basis Theorem. The proof is constructive: we provide an algorithm that, given any H in Cimg, produces a DAG G with relative operator error at most epsilon and graph complexity within prescribed bounds. We further prove that the library is minimal: removing any single primitive causes at least one modality to lose its epsilon-approximate representation. A systematic analysis of nonlinearities in imaging physics shows they fall into two structural categories: pointwise scalar functions (handled by Transform) and self-consistent iterations (unrolled into existing linear primitives). Empirical validation on 31 linear modalities confirms eimg below 0.01 with at most 5 nodes and depth 5, and we provide constructive DAG decompositions for 9 additional nonlinear modalities. These results establish mathematical foundations for the Physics World Model (PWM) framework.</p></details> |  |

Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://AdaWorldPolicy.github.io</p></details> |

Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOCA-Bench: Beyond Semantic Perception to Predictive World Modeling via Hegelian Ontological-Causal Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19571v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Text-Guided Vision Model for Enhanced Recognition of Small Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19503v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Applied Computer Science (2026)</p></details> |
| **[MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19285v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DD0922/MRI-Contrast-Enhancement-Kinetics-World-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[K-Search: LLM Kernel Generation via Co-Evolving Intrinsic World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19128v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents via Environment Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847v4)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information from interaction that is available during deployment. First, an online syntactic alignment (SA) method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding (DG) method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with an in-context world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%. We release our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available here: https://github.com/r2llab/GTTA</p></details> |

However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026, 19 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07854v3)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning world models compress visual input into latent spaces, discarding the spatial structure that characterizes sensory cortex. We propose isomorphic world models: architectures preserving sensory topology so that physics prediction becomes geometric propagation rather than abstract state transition. We implement this using neural fields with motor-gated channels, where activity evolves through local lateral connectivity and motor commands multiplicatively modulate specific populations. Three experiments support this approach: (1) local connectivity is sufficient to learn ballistic physics, with predictions traversing intermediate locations rather than "teleporting"; (2) policies trained entirely in imagination transfer to real physics at nearly twice the rate of latent-space alternatives; and (3) motor-gated channels spontaneously develop body-selective encoding through visuomotor prediction alone. These findings suggest intuitive physics and body schema may share a common origin in spatially structured neural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v3)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in autonomous endovascular navigation, but generalization across 'long' navigation tasks remains challenging. We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature. While HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies, the simulation-to-real transition introduces challenges. Future work will refine RL strategies using world models and validate performance on unseen in vitro data, advancing autonomous MT towards clinical translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a human-centric video world model that is conditioned on both tracked head pose and joint-level hand poses. For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page here: https://codeysun.github.io/generated-reality</p></details> |
| **[AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://h-zhao1997.github.io/frappe</p></details> |

We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07463v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</p></details> |  |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot.

How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/ccolas/language_and_experience Demo: cedriccolas.com/demos/language_and_experience</p></details> |

Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.</p></details> |  |

However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Model-Augmented Web Agents with Action Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |
| **[Cold-Start Personalization via Training-Free Priors from Structured World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15012v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[World Models for Policy Refinement in StarCraft II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14857v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06130v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Compact LLM Deployment and World Model Assisted Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13628v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures/tables</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 0 figures.
