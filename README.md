| **[EditGarment: An Instruction-Based Garment Editing Dataset Constructed with Automated MLLM Synthesis and Semantic-Aware Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03497v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena. We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding. Database and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/aiben-ch/GOBench.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CAD-MLLM: Unifying Multimodality-Conditioned CAD Generation With MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04954v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to design a unified Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generation system that can easily generate CAD models based on the user's inputs in the form of textual description, images, point clouds, or even a combination of them. Towards this goal, we introduce the CAD-MLLM, the first system capable of generating parametric CAD models conditioned on the multimodal input. Specifically, within the CAD-MLLM framework, we leverage the command sequences of CAD models and then employ advanced large language models (LLMs) to align the feature space across these diverse multi-modalities data and CAD models' vectorized representations. To facilitate the model training, we design a comprehensive data construction and annotation pipeline that equips each CAD model with corresponding multimodal data. Our resulting dataset, named Omni-CAD, is the first multimodal CAD dataset that contains textual description, multi-view images, points, and command sequence for each CAD model. It contains approximately 450K instances and their CAD construction sequences. To thoroughly evaluate the quality of our generated CAD models, we go beyond current evaluation metrics that focus on reconstruction quality by introducing additional metrics that assess topology quality and surface enclosure extent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAD-MLLM significantly outperforms existing conditional generative methods and remains highly robust to noises and missing points.

| **[Do MLLMs Capture How Interfaces Guide User Behavior? A Benchmark for Multimodal UI/UX Design Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User interface (UI) design goes beyond visuals, guiding user behavior and overall user experience (UX). Strategically crafted interfaces, for example, can boost sign-ups and drive business sales, underscoring the shift toward UI/UX as a unified design concept. While recent studies have explored UI quality evaluation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they largely focus on surface-level features, overlooking behavior-oriented aspects. To fill this gap, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a novel benchmark for assessing models' multimodal understanding of UI/UX design. It includes 300 diverse real-world UI image pairs, each consisting of two design variants A/B-tested at scale by actual companies, where one was empirically validated to steer more user actions than the other. Each pair is accompanied one or more of 684 expert-curated rationales that capture key factors behind each winning design's effectiveness, spanning diverse cognitive dimensions of UX. Our benchmark supports two core tasks: (1) selecting the more effective UI/UX design by predicting the A/B test verified winner and (2) assessing how well a model, given the winner, can explain its effectiveness in alignment with expert reasoning. Experiments across several MLLMs show that current models exhibit limited nuanced reasoning about UI/UX design and its behavioral impact. We believe our work will foster research in UI/UX understanding and enable broader applications such as behavior-aware interface optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 25 figures, Our code and dataset: https://github.com/jeochris/wiserui-bench</p></details> |
| **[Free-MoRef: Instantly Multiplexing Context Perception Capabilities of Video-MLLMs within Single Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02134v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency. Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach \textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Affordance Benchmark for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00893v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance theory suggests that environments inherently provide action possibilities shaping perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce **A4Bench**, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 questionanswer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. We evaluate 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) and compare them to human performance. Results show that proprietary models generally outperform open-source ones, yet all models perform far below humans, especially in transformative affordance. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartEdit: How Far Are MLLMs From Automating Chart Analysis? Evaluating MLLMs' Capability via Chart Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11935v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating chart rendering code, editing charts via code presents a greater challenge. This task demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding and reasoning capacities, which are labor-intensive. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities, current evaluations rely on limited case studies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework. In this work, we propose \textsc{ChartEdit}, a novel benchmark designed for chart editing tasks, featuring $1405$ diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, each manually annotated and validated for accuracy. Utilizing \textsc{ChartEdit}, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream MLLMs across two types of experiments at both the code and chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$, highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast, small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need for further development in this area. Code is available at https://github.com/xxlllz/ChartEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Findings, camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[MLLM-based Discovery of Intrinsic Coordinates and Governing Equations from High-Dimensional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11940v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering governing equations from scientific data is crucial for understanding the evolution of systems, and is typically framed as a search problem within a candidate equation space. However, the high-dimensional nature of dynamical systems leads to an exponentially expanding equation space, making the search process extremely challenging. The visual perception and pre-trained scientific knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLM) hold promise for providing effective navigation in high-dimensional equation spaces. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot method based on MLLM for automatically discovering physical coordinates and governing equations from high-dimensional data. Specifically, we design a series of enhanced visual prompts for MLLM to enhance its spatial perception. In addition, MLLM's domain knowledge is employed to navigate the search process within the equation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two representative types of systems demonstrate that the proposed method effectively discovers the physical coordinates and equations from both simulated and real experimental data, with long-term extrapolation accuracy improved by approximately 26.96% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to MLLMs to Agents: A Survey of Emerging Paradigms in Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses within LLM Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15170v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BusterX++: Towards Unified Cross-Modal AI-Generated Content Detection and Explanation with MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14632v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[BusterX: MLLM-Powered AI-Generated Video Forgery Detection and Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12620v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT: Enhancing MLLMs for Industrial Anomaly Detection via Difficulty-Aware GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21619v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21420v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Physics Simulation for 3D Scenes via MLLM-Guided Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[MLLM-based Speech Recognition: When and How is Multimodality Beneficial?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19037v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2) Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoExoBench: A Benchmark for First- and Third-person View Video Understanding in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18342v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence, enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored. To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MathOPEval: A Fine-grained Evaluation Benchmark for Visual Operations of MLLMs in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18140v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation. To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Constructing Ophthalmic MLLM for Positioning-diagnosis Collaboration Through Clinical Cognitive Chain Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17539v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Reasoning of Multi-Image Grounding in MLLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00748v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications that involve complex multi-image compositions and multi-modal instructions, revealing limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04% on MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1% and +2.4% over the base model on BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While traditional video classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper, we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5% of direct full-scale deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready for ACL 2025</p></details> |

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>SUBMI...</summary><p>SUBMIT TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS</p></details> |

This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g., SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement, which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and improved MLLM generation and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts. In order to facilitate this research, we construct a new dataset MC-Bench that features 2K high-quality and manually annotated samples. Each sample consists of an instance-level labeled image pair and a corresponding text prompt that indicates the target instances in the images. These text prompts are highly open-ended and follow three distinct styles, covering 20 practical skills. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and foundation models with potential multi-context visual grounding capabilities, along with our developed simple yet effective agentic baseline and a finetuned baseline by multi-context instruction tuning. Our evaluation reveals a non-trivial performance gap between existing MLLMs and humans, along with some insightful observations that suggest potential future directions. We hope that MC-Bench and our empirical findings encourage the research community to further advance the untapped potentials of MLLMs in instance-level tasks, particularly in multi-image contexts.

Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been released on https://av-reasoner.github.io.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025; 19 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

However, these models often produce errors that are difficult to detect without sight, posing safety and social risks in scenarios from medication identification to outfit selection. While BLV MLLM users use creative workarounds such as cross-checking between tools and consulting sighted individuals, these approaches are often time-consuming and impractical. We explore how systematically surfacing variations across multiple MLLM responses can support BLV users to detect unreliable information without visually inspecting the image. We contribute a design space for eliciting and presenting variations in MLLM descriptions, a prototype system implementing three variation presentation styles, and findings from a user study with 15 BLV participants. Our results demonstrate that presenting variations significantly increases users' ability to identify unreliable claims (by 4.9x using our approach compared to single descriptions) and significantly decreases perceived reliability of MLLM responses. 14 of 15 participants preferred seeing variations of MLLM responses over a single description, and all expressed interest in using our system for tasks from understanding a tornado's path to posting an image on social media.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval.

We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/mshalimay/mllm-verifiers-abias-sgv</p></details> |

While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

| **[A Training-Free, Task-Agnostic Framework for Enhancing MLLM Performance on High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10202v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images, their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms.

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.</p></details> | Work in progress |

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models will be released.</p></details> | 14 pages,4 figures |

We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers. By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM.

However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p></details> | 31pages, 14 figures |

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Refined Policy Distillation: From VLA Generalists to RL Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in real-world experiments. However, their success rates are often not on par with expert policies, and they require fine-tuning when the setup changes. In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that bridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with behavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into compact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during RL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in simulation. While this is a key requirement for applying RL, it also yields new insights beyond existing studies on VLA performance in real-world settings. Our experimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables the RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both dense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than the RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve. Our code, dataset, VLA checkpoints, and videos are available at https://refined-policy-distillation.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at IROS 2026</p></details> |

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  |

This progress inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT, an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods, achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[RICL: Adding In-Context Adaptability to Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02062v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments. However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning. Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20 demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning interface for new manipulation tasks.

| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $π_0$ using Text Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Despite their significant capabilities, VLA models introduce new attack surfaces. This paper systematically evaluates their robustness. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV camera ready; Github: https://github.com/William-wAng618/roboticAttack Homepage: https://vlaattacker.github.io/</p></details> |

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks. Furthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including recognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://chain-of-affordance.github.io</p></details> |

This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.

Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is an error in this paper, and as the author, I request retraction</p></details> |

However, VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by 44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA prediction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks. Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision.

However, existing vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm, Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with efficient policy learning.</p></details> | 38 pages |

However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence Calibration in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17383v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants, finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been withdrawn due to an internal institutional policy that prohibits preprint submissions to arXiv</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes. Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

While models like OpenVLA showcase the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed and memory efficiency.

However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations.

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the heavy reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $ 30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51% improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using replay-based video validation.

Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26 foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity, variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal alignment strategies.

However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency. This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35x faster inference and 145 Hz throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.

This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p></details> |  |

We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hijacking JARVIS: Benchmarking Mobile GUI Agents against Unprivileged Third Parties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04227v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58 reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content, while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14 popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TriVLA: A Triple-System-Based Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01424v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.</p></details> | 70 pages, 5 figures |

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a manuscript submitted for peer review</p></details> |

This extensive dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics, resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner, from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30% higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application domains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24044v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy. Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

| **[4D-VLA: Spatiotemporal Vision-Language-Action Pretraining with Cross-Scene Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22242v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge. Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead. Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Our WorldVLA intergrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models, highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner. This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the generation of the current action, which shows significant performance improvement in the action chunk generation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/WorldVLA</p></details> |

We study the active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools. We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions. Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments.

Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current day missions are generally in the AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved. We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots. FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS) method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActionSink: Toward Precise Robot Manipulation with Dynamic Integration of Action Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03218v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\% success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.</p></details> |  |

Traditional navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters, compared to reactive baseline planners.

In contrast, insect-scale aerial robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$ improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11 seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 26 supplementary pages, 6 main figures, 16 supplementary figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Human-Intent Modeling for Contextual Robot-to-Human Handovers of Arbitrary Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02982v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences. We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences.

Here, we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry, autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance, code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles, though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.</p></details> |  |

Detecting microplastics and mapping their concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces. This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and high microplastic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

To this end, we ran Participatory Design workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite much overlap in their design concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonoForce: Self-supervised Learning of Physics-informed Model for Predicting Robot-terrain Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09007v6)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autonomous navigation of mobile robots on rigid terrain is a well-explored problem, navigating on deformable terrain such as tall grass or bushes remains a challenge. To address it, we introduce an explainable, physics-aware and end-to-end differentiable model which predicts the outcome of robot-terrain interaction from camera images, both on rigid and non-rigid terrain. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module which predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from onboard cameras, followed by a white-box module, which transforms these forces and a control signals into predicted trajectories, using only the laws of classical mechanics. The differentiable white-box module allows backpropagating the predicted trajectory errors into the black-box module, serving as a self-supervised loss that measures consistency between the predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories of the robot. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset and our data has shown that while the prediction capabilities are comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on rigid terrain, MonoForce shows superior accuracy on non-rigid terrain such as tall grass or bushes. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we release both the code and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE IROS 2024.

However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a new virtual-model control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators, without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment. Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and platform independence.</p></details> |  |

Like a child, the AGI robot would have to learn through input and experiences, constantly progressing and advancing its abilities over time. The AGI robot would require an intelligence more close to human's intelligence: it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan. Based on this approach an Intensional many-sorted First-order Logic (IFOL), as an extension of a standard FOL with Tarskian's semantics, is proposed in order to avoid the problems of standard 2-valued FOL with paradoxes (inconsistent formulae) and a necessity for robots to work with incomplete (unknown) knowledge as well. This is a more sophisticated version of IFOL with the same syntax but different semantics, able to deal with truth-ordering and knowledge-ordering as well, based on the well known Belnap's billatice with four truth-values that extend the set of classical two truth-values.</p></details> | 28 pages |

It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025, website - https://shin0805.github.io/flying-anchor/, YouTube - https://youtu.be/BXdlXf7BNQQ</p></details> |
| **[Failure-Aware Multi-Robot Coordination for Resilient and Adaptive Target Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02529v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

A usability study on LLM-powered narrative Humanoid-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02505v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in human-robot interaction research lies in developing robotic systems that can effectively perceive and interpret social cues, facilitating natural and adaptive interactions. In this work, we present a novel framework for enhancing the attention of the iCub humanoid robot by integrating advanced perceptual abilities to recognise social cues, understand surroundings through generative models, such as ChatGPT, and respond with contextually appropriate social behaviour. Specifically, we propose an interaction task implementing a narrative protocol (storytelling task) in which the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability and the quality of experience perceived by participants interacting with the system. Such a system can be beneficial in promoting effective human robot collaborations, especially in assistance, education and rehabilitation scenarios where the social awareness and the robot responsiveness play a pivotal role.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</p></details> |  |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  |

Cholecystectomy, the gallbladder removal, is particularly well-suited for automation due to its standardized procedural steps and distinct anatomical boundaries. A key challenge in automating this procedure is dissecting with accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents a vision-based autonomous robotic dissection architecture that integrates real-time segmentation, keypoint detection, grasping and stretching the gallbladder with the left arm, and dissecting with the other arm. We introduce an improved segmentation dataset based on videos of robotic cholecystectomy performed by various surgeons, incorporating a new ``liver bed'' class to enhance boundary tracking after multiple rounds of dissection. Our system employs state-of-the-art segmentation models and an adaptive boundary extraction method that maintains accuracy despite tissue deformations and visual variations. Moreover, we implemented an automated grasping and pulling strategy to optimize tissue tension before dissection upon our previous work. Ex vivo evaluations on porcine livers demonstrate that our framework significantly improves dissection precision and consistency, marking a step toward fully autonomous robotic cholecystectomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

The software of such robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution. This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case, yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15% reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot software testing.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper, we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on both simulation and real-world robotic environments.

Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain. Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their uncertain behaviors.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios, environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse array of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we evaluate our approach in terms of balance maintenance, velocity control, and responses to slip and push disturbances. Additionally, we analyze autonomy through metrics like the cost of transport and ground reaction force. Our method advances robust control strategies for point-foot bipedal robots, offering insights into broader locomotion.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, technical report</p></details> |

To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friction-Aware Safety Locomotion for Wheeled-legged Robots using Vision Language Models and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09845v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling Wheeled-legged robots is challenging especially on slippery surfaces due to their dependence on continuous ground contact. Unlike quadrupeds or bipeds, which can leverage multiple fixed contact points for recovery, wheeled-legged robots are highly susceptible to slip, where even momentary loss of traction can result in irrecoverable instability. Anticipating ground physical properties such as friction before contact would allow proactive control adjustments, reducing slip risk. In this paper, we propose a friction-aware safety locomotion framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy. Our method employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to estimate the Coefficient of Friction (CoF), which is then explicitly incorporated into the RL policy. This enables the robot to adapt its speed based on predicted friction conditions before contact. The framework is validated through experiments in both simulation and on a physical customized Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP). Experimental results show that our approach successfully completes trajectory tracking tasks on slippery surfaces, whereas baseline methods relying solely on proprioceptive feedback fail. These findings highlight the importance and effectiveness of explicitly predicting and utilizing ground friction information for safe locomotion. They also point to a promising research direction in exploring the use of VLMs for estimating ground conditions, which remains a significant challenge for purely vision-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Humanoids 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring environment exploitation for self-reconfiguration in modular robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01829v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls, communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion, adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features -- ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots' capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.</p></details> |  |

However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.</p></details> |  |

By introducing three roles: Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for multi-robot systems. Our approach emphasizes creativity, expressiveness, and intuitiveness as key elements for future human-robot interaction design.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 2 figures, UIST Poster, adjunct proceedings</p></details> |

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

However, large-scale demonstrations captured by remote operation tend to take extremely high costs and fail to scale up the data size in an efficient manner. Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way for large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity modeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the RoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian Reconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine. It can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories, and scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation for different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer experiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. We compared the test results of RoboGSim data and real robot data on both RoboGSim and real robot platforms. The experimental results show that the RoboGSim data model can achieve zero-shot performance on the real robot, with results comparable to real robot data. Additionally, in experiments with novel perspectives and novel scenes, the RoboGSim data model performed even better on the real robot than the real robot data model. This not only helps reduce the sim2real gap but also addresses the limitations of real robot data collection, such as its single-source and high cost. We hope RoboGSim serves as a closed-loop simulator for fair comparison on policy learning. More information can be found on our project page https://robogsim.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency, reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of collisions with glass objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 6th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VFP: Variational Flow-Matching Policy for Multi-Modal Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01622v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact model size.

While current humanoids bear human-like appearances, none have embodied true humaneness, remaining distant from achieving human-like to human-level intelligence. The rapid recent advancements in generative AI and (multimodal) large language models have further reignited and escalated interest in humanoids towards real-time, interactive, and multimodal designs and applications, such as fostering humanoid workers, advisers, educators, medical professionals, caregivers, and receptionists. These unveil boundless opportunities of transforming 1) AI robotics into a research era of humanoid AI, and 2) AI robots into new-generation humanoid AI robots (AI humanoids). Our unique and comprehensive review of about 30 reported humanoids discloses a systematic terminology and a paradigmatic landscape of human-looking to human-like and human-level humanoids. It inspires comprehensive new perspectives and directions of humanoid AI as an area: transitioning from human-looking to humane humanoids, humanizing humanoids with functional and nonfunctional specifications, and cultivating technical and actionable advances of AI humanoids. Humanoid AI and AI humanoids nurture symbiotic advancements and future opportunities of synthesizing and transforming humanity modeling and conventional, generative to human-level AI into humanoid robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, BC faces significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure, limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning. CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline methods fail to perform competitively.

HALO learns a reward model from offline data, leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training, actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO, we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a 12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using 720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO (Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations, thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks, D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

These systems aim to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains, however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions.

The primary challenge lies in determining how to push objects, group them, and execute simultaneous grasping for respective groups while considering object distribution and the hardware constraints of the robot. Traditional rule-based methods struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an imitation learning-based approach. We collect a series of expert demonstrations through teleoperation and train a diffusion policy network, enabling the robot to dynamically generate action sequences for pushing, grouping, and grasping, thereby facilitating efficient multi-object grasping and delivery. We conducted experiments to evaluate the method under different training dataset sizes, varying object quantities, and real-world object scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively and adaptively generate multi-object grouping and grasping strategies. With the support of more training data, imitation learning is expected to be an effective approach for solving the multi-object grasping problem.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations, respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Speeding up Diffusion Policy without Additional Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21452v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks. However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy (CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP (Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy, with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.</p></details> |  |

Despite their promising results, these models are computationally expensive and suffer from weak perception. To address these limitations, we present FlowNav, a novel approach that uses a combination of CFM and depth priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to learn action policies for robot navigation. FlowNav is significantly more accurate and faster at navigation and exploration than state-of-the-art methods. We validate our contributions using real robot experiments in multiple environments, demonstrating improved navigation reliability and accuracy.

| **[The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722v4)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponential stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and diffusion policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 2 figures, updated proof sketch</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to create a robotic system that can create simple pottery goals with only pinch-based actions. This pinch pottery task allows us to explore the challenges of a highly multi-modal and long-horizon deformable manipulation task. To this end, we present PinchBot, a goal-conditioned diffusion policy model that when combined with pre-trained 3D point cloud embeddings, task progress prediction and collision-constrained action projection, is able to successfully create a variety of simple pottery goals.

| **[VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucd-dare.github.io/VITA/</p></details> |
| **[Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/mshalimay/mllm-verifiers-abias-sgv</p></details> |
| **[AirLLM: Diffusion Policy-based Adaptive LoRA for Remote Fine-Tuning of LLM over the Air](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11515v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This limitation primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ark: An Open-source Python-based Framework for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21628v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Aware Visuomotor Diffusion Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06710v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Move in Rhythm: Task-Conditioned Motion Policies with Orbital Stability Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10602v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability, excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot - demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.</p></details> | 73 pages |
| **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Latent Action Diffusion for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14608v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end learning approaches offer great potential for robotic manipulation, but their impact is constrained by data scarcity and heterogeneity across different embodiments. In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 25% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Careful Examination of Large Behavior Models for Multitask Dexterous Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05331v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly, using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover, performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows. Project page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis.

A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications.

However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset.

However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

To address this challenge, we propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in real-world settings.

| **[Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemoDiffusion: One-Shot Human Imitation using pre-trained Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20668v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

However, diffusion models typically rely on large parameter UNet backbones as policy networks, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising solution for efficient modeling, offering low computational complexity and strong performance in sequence modeling. In this work, we propose the Mamba Policy, a lighter but stronger policy that reduces the parameter count by over 80% compared to the original policy network while achieving superior performance. Specifically, we introduce the XMamba Block, which effectively integrates input information with conditional features and leverages a combination of Mamba and Attention mechanisms for deep feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy's enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework. Real-world experiments are also conducted to further validate its effectiveness.

AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1) Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3) Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction, totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUPID: Curating Data your Robot Loves with Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19121v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://tianxingchen.github.io/G3Flow/, accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

| **[HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15947v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) are emerging as a promising paradigm to support various low-altitude services through integrated air-ground infrastructure. To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14769v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[H$^3$DP: Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy for Visuomotor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07819v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Most common steering approaches, like goal-conditioning, require training the robot policy with a distribution of test-time objectives in mind. To overcome this limitation, we present DynaGuide, a steering method for diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the diffusion denoising process. DynaGuide separates the dynamics model from the base policy, which gives it multiple advantages, including the ability to steer towards multiple objectives, enhance underrepresented base policy behaviors, and maintain robustness on low-quality objectives. The separate guidance signal also allows DynaGuide to work with off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion policies. We demonstrate the performance and features of DynaGuide against other steering approaches in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing an average steering success of 70% on a set of articulated CALVIN tasks and outperforming goal-conditioning by 5.4x when steered with low-quality objectives. We also successfully steer an off-the-shelf real robot policy to express preference for particular objects and even create novel behavior.

| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13111v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

| **[Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12678v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
