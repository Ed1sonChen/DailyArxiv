| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HueManity: Probing Fine-Grained Visual Perception in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03194v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/mshalimay/mllm-verifiers-abias-sgv</p></details> |
| **[DisCo: Towards Distinct and Coherent Visual Encapsulation in Video MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10302v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

| **[A Training-Free, Task-Agnostic Framework for Enhancing MLLM Performance on High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10202v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images, their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/yenncye/ECP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521v4)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 82 pages |
| **[SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing MLLMs encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench.

| **[A Survey on MLLM-based Visually Rich Document Understanding: Methods, Challenges, and Emerging Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09861v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field, driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[InternVideo2.5: Empowering Video MLLMs with Long and Rich Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12386v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to improve the performance of video multimodal large language models (MLLM) via long and rich context (LRC) modeling. As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

| **[EduFlow: Advancing MLLMs' Problem-Solving Proficiency through Multi-Stage, Multi-Perspective Critique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09374v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning. Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models will be released.</p></details> | 14 pages,4 figures |
| **[Visual Semantic Description Generation with MLLMs for Image-Text Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08590v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete, structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers. By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME2025 oral</p></details> |
| **[Improving MLLM's Document Image Machine Translation via Synchronously Self-reviewing Its OCR Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08309v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p></details> | 31pages, 14 figures |
| **[OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07984v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[HV-MMBench: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Tempo-R0: A Video-MLLM for Temporal Video Grounding through Efficient Temporal Sensing Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04702v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05344v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which only adds six spatial visual tokens to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1) We propose a novel Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches: "from central region to global" and "from abstract to specific". Then, a cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information, enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants: LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA, achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple tasks with nearly identical inference latency.

| **[Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

However, in the realm of video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US) Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10 on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\% higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, they often excessively rely on textual information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning. Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when, where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks. SAILViT series models are released at https://huggingface.co/BytedanceDouyinContent.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release SAILViT, a series of versatile vision foundation models</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose SimVec, a novel simplified vector format that encodes chart elements such as mark type, position, and size. The effectiveness of SimVec is demonstrated by using MLLMs to reconstruct chart information from SimVec formats. Then, we build a new visualization dataset, SimVecVis, to enhance the performance of MLLMs in visualization understanding, which consists of three key dimensions: bitmap images of charts, their SimVec representations, and corresponding data-centric question-answering (QA) pairs with explanatory chain-of-thought (CoT) descriptions. We finetune state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., MiniCPM and Qwen-VL), using SimVecVis with different dataset dimensions. The experimental results show that it leads to substantial performance improvements of MLLMs with good spatial perception capabilities (e.g., MiniCPM) in data-centric QA tasks.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Reasoning of Multi-Image Grounding in MLLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00748v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\% improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\% and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

| **[R1-Track: Direct Application of MLLMs to Visual Object Tracking via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21980v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy, which leverages both local functional attribution and global information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility. This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAP-Diffusion: Enriching Descriptions with MLLMs for Enhanced Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23641v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMReason: An Open-Ended Multi-Modal Multi-Step Reasoning Benchmark for MLLMs Toward AGI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23563v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[OrderChain: Towards General Instruct-Tuning for Stimulating the Ordinal Understanding Ability of MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04801v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting MLLM Reasoning with Text-Debiased Hint-GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23905v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent problem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises the final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view that PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance using an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still struggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the performance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data utilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the MLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses image condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO training. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves data utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying difficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating the token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment results on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large margin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/Hint-GRPO.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, ACL 2025 |

Although visual cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations: the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations. We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps: first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution</p></details> |  |

To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/QiWang98/VideoRFT</p></details> |

These MLLMs have been reported to excel in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.</p></details> |  |

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Specifically, we replicate a human-subject experiment about perceiving quality (namely stress) in network layouts using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception. Explanations from the models provide descriptions similar to those used by the human participants (e.g., even distribution of nodes and uniform edge lengths).</p></details> |  |

However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26 foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity, variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of generalist robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to annual review in control</p></details> |

However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOTE: Vision-Language-Action Optimization with Trajectory Ensemble Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05116v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency. This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35x faster inference and 145 Hz throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |

This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p></details> |  |

We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model Dreamed with Comprehensive World Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04447v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite notable advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58 reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content, while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14 popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.</p></details> | 70 pages, 5 figures |

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a manuscript submitted for peer review</p></details> |

This extensive dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics, resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner, from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30% higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application domains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24044v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy. Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

| **[4D-VLA: Spatiotemporal Vision-Language-Action Pretraining with Cross-Scene Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22242v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge. Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead. Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21539v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models, highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner. This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the generation of the current action, which shows significant performance improvement in the action chunk generation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/WorldVLA</p></details> |

VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |
| **[Parallels Between VLA Model Post-Training and Human Motor Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20966v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1) enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3) deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

| **[Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19850v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training, UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous driving.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[CronusVLA: Transferring Latent Motion Across Time for Multi-Frame Prediction in Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19816v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2) multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with 70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.</p></details> | 36 pages, 21 figures |
| **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLRC: Reinforcement Learning-based Recovery for Compressed Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17639v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs.

However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulation manipulation.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Existing methods for few-shot manipulation often rely on simulation-augmented data or pre-built modules like grasping and pose estimation, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and lack extensibility. While large-scale imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting these general-purpose policies to specific tasks in data-scarce settings remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose ControlVLA, a novel framework that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric representations via a ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, to introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge, ControlVLA zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to gradually adapt the pre-trained manipulation policies. In real-world experiments across 6 diverse tasks, including pouring cubes and folding clothes, our method achieves a 76.7% success rate while requiring only 10-20 demonstrations -- a significant improvement over traditional approaches that require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable success. Additional experiments highlight ControlVLA's extensibility to long-horizon tasks and robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://controlvla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ember-lab-berkeley.github.io/LeVERB-Website/</p></details> |

However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in procedurally out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLMs and VLAs - including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA, Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST - on diverse procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexity; (2) VLAs generally outperforms other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering. We release our benchmark, evaluation framework, and findings to enable the assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in their application to out-of-distribution digital tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 26 figures |

Yet existing approaches are constrained by their dependence on hand-crafted skills, extensive parameter tuning, or computationally intensive models unsuitable for onboard use. We introduce GRaD-Nav++, a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that runs fully onboard and follows natural-language commands in real time. Our policy is trained in a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) simulator via Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DiffRL), enabling efficient learning of low-level control from visual and linguistic inputs. At its core is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) action head, which adaptively routes computation to improve generalization while mitigating forgetting. In multi-task generalization experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings. These results establish a new benchmark for fully onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) flight and demonstrate that compact, efficient models can enable reliable, language-guided navigation without relying on external infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.

| **[CEED-VLA: Consistency Vision-Language-Action Model with Early-Exit Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13725v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding and generalization capabilities. Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.

| **[ROSA: Harnessing Robot States for Vision-Language and Action Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13679v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Surgical AI: Surgeon Style Fingerprinting and Privacy Risk Quantification via Discrete Diffusion in a Vision-Language-Action Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08185v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles shaped by training, experience, and motor behavior-yet most surgical AI systems overlook this personalization signal. We propose a novel agentic modeling approach for surgeon-specific behavior prediction in robotic surgery, combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Gesture prediction is framed as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including surgical video, intent language, and personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill. These embeddings are encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

| **[RationalVLA: A Rational Vision-Language-Action Model with Dual System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10826v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is https://irpn-eai.github.io/RationalVLA.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFE: Multitask Failure Detection for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09937v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

| **[From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09930v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.

| **[HiBerNAC: Hierarchical Brain-emulated Robotic Neural Agent Collective for Disentangling Complex Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08296v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10786v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</p></details> |  |

This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 SICE Festival with Annual Conference (SICE FES)</p></details> |

Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance.

In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript combined with Supplementary Materials File for arXiv submission</p></details> |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions, allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34 participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such technologies in complex, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

FL has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness. MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of "top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work is accepted for presentation at IEEE SMC 2025</p></details> |

Sidewalk delivery robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101 trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed, duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.</p></details> |  |

Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides simulation benchmarks that compare safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups at the same time. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research.

However, unreliable travel times on sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted, ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their motion planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths. By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning, ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 37 pages, 33 figures |

These applications include problems such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture, building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic, contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN)</p></details> |
| **[Hi Robot: Open-Ended Instruction Following with Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19417v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

| **[LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; under review for IEEE Robotics & Automation - Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This systematic review examines the advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where robots provide meaningful and active support to human surgeons. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, resulting in the selection of 32 studies for detailed analysis. Two primary collaborative setups were identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption, including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends, identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions essential to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot collaboration in surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN)</p></details> |

The key idea is to leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body rotations.

Unstructured data, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as emails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of enterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting meaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to structured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors. However, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its application to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses this limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem (UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural language processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to effectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research involved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent evaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of UNDRESS in enhancing RPA capabilities for unstructured data, providing a significant advancement in the field. The findings suggest that this system could facilitate broader RPA adoption across processes traditionally hindered by unstructured data, thereby improving overall business process efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AUTOMATE 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the first physical deployment of an integrated actor-planner system that shares hierarchical operational models for both acting and planning, interleaving the Reactive Acting Engine (RAE) with an anytime UCT-like Monte Carlo planner (UPOM). We implement RAE+UPOM on a mobile manipulator in a real-world deployment for an object collection task.

| **[RA-DP: Rapid Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Training-Free High-frequency Robotics Replanning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04051v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models exhibit impressive scalability in robotic task learning, yet they struggle to adapt to novel, highly dynamic environments. This limitation primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients. Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%, respectively. The video of the experiment is available at: https://youtu.be/wHcWzOcoMPM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) 2025</p></details> |

The system integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties and clutter.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[A Robust Controller based on Gaussian Processes for Robotic Manipulators with Unknown Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11170v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty, we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of freedom planar robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Force-Based Viscosity and Elasticity Measurements for Material Biomechanical Characterisation with a Collaborative Robotic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11133v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body, which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials, including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the potential use of robots for such clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</p></details> |  |

Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the change in uncertainty in the visualization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Whom to Respond To? A Transformer-Based Model for Multi-Party Social Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10960v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches. Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Modeling and Structural Optimization of Multi-magnet Embedded Soft Continuum Robots for Enhanced Kinematic Performances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10950v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots (MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Previous works in unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2025, Interactive Perception, Segmentation, Robotics, Computer Vision</p></details> |

Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments. Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 21 figures, submitted to journal for potential publication</p></details> |

This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26 foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity, variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of generalist robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to annual review in control</p></details> |

However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Multi-Stage Fall Detection Framework with Semi-supervised Federated Learning and Robotic Vision Confirmation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10474v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to 99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3% accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults, but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.</p></details> |  |

Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education, experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and candidate notifications.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging advanced technologies to assist parents in co-regulating emotions with their children. However, limited research has explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with SAR to facilitate emotion co-regulation between parents and children with neurodevelopmental disorders. To address this gap, we developed an LLM-powered social robot by deploying a speech communication module on the MiRo-E robotic platform. This supervised autonomous system integrates LLM prompts and robotic behaviors to deliver tailored interventions for both parents and neurodivergent children. Pilot tests were conducted with two parent-child dyads, followed by a qualitative analysis. The findings reveal MiRo-E's positive impacts on interaction dynamics and its potential to facilitate emotion regulation, along with identified design and technical challenges. Based on these insights, we provide design implications to advance the future development of LLM-powered SAR for mental health applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for the IROS 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Robot Cooperative Herding through Backstepping Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10249v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel cooperative herding strategy through backstepping control barrier functions (CBFs), which coordinates multiple herders to herd a group of evaders safely towards a designated goal region. For the herding system with heterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders can only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the evaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive interactions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently renders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first construct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision avoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we reformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure and employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the hierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order system. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on backstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the goal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the proposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and applicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has explored turn-taking models in controlled environments, their robustness in real-world settings remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a noise-robust voice activity projection (VAP) model, based on a Transformer architecture, to enhance real-time turn-taking in dialogue robots. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a field experiment in a shopping mall, comparing the VAP system with a conventional cloud-based speech recognition system. Our analysis covered both subjective user evaluations and objective behavioral analysis. The results showed that the proposed system significantly reduced response latency, leading to a more natural conversation where both the robot and users responded faster. The subjective evaluations suggested that faster responses contribute to a better interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2025 (IROS 2025) and represents the author's version of the work</p></details> |

The approach integrates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque tracking, adaptability, and stability in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design, open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal data, safety risks, and computational constraints. Through this lens, this paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time operation, grounding, resilience, and trust. The review concludes with a roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a Universal Robot UR5 collaborative robot within a real-time robotic framework based on ROS2. The results demonstrate that even extremely lightweight models can deliver accurate and responsive hand gesture-based control for collaborative robots, opening new possibilities for natural human-robot interaction in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, in some cases, policies may require refinement to achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score. Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive scores for the competition tasks.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic locomotion on abrupt surfaces, as opposed to walking on rough terrains, demands the integration of proprioceptive and exteroceptive perception to enable explosive movements. In this paper, we propose SF-TIM (Simple Framework combining Terrain Imagination and Measurement), a single-policy method that enhances quadrupedal robot jumping agility, while preserving their fundamental blind walking capabilities. In addition, we introduce a terrain-guided reward design specifically to assist quadrupedal robots in high jumping, improving their performance in this task. To narrow the simulation-to-reality gap in quadrupedal robot learning, we introduce a stable and high-speed elevation map generation framework, enabling zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer of locomotion ability. Our algorithm has been deployed and validated on both the small-/large-size quadrupedal robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications: the robot has successfully traversed various high platforms and gaps, showing the robustness of our proposed approach.

Unlike studies that focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective. Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability, which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical applicability</p></details> | IJCAI'2025 |

While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Springer Nature with the 14th bioinspired and biohybrid systems conference in Sheffield, and presented at the conference in July 2025</p></details> |

However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/mshalimay/mllm-verifiers-abias-sgv</p></details> |
| **[AirLLM: Diffusion Policy-based Adaptive LoRA for Remote Fine-Tuning of LLM over the Air](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11515v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This limitation primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Aware Visuomotor Diffusion Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06710v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.</p></details> |  |

In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability, excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot - demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.</p></details> | 73 pages |
| **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Latent Action Diffusion for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14608v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end learning approaches offer great potential for robotic manipulation, but their impact is constrained by data scarcity and heterogeneity across different embodiments. In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 25% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Careful Examination of Large Behavior Models for Multitask Dexterous Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05331v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly, using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover, performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows. Project page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

| **[SE(3)-Equivariant Diffusion Policy in Spherical Fourier Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01723v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025.

| **[Diffusion Policies for Risk-Averse Behavior Modeling in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17646v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications.

However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset.

| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

To address this challenge, we propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in real-world settings.

| **[Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemoDiffusion: One-Shot Human Imitation using pre-trained Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20668v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

However, diffusion models typically rely on large parameter UNet backbones as policy networks, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising solution for efficient modeling, offering low computational complexity and strong performance in sequence modeling. In this work, we propose the Mamba Policy, a lighter but stronger policy that reduces the parameter count by over 80% compared to the original policy network while achieving superior performance. Specifically, we introduce the XMamba Block, which effectively integrates input information with conditional features and leverages a combination of Mamba and Attention mechanisms for deep feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy's enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework. Real-world experiments are also conducted to further validate its effectiveness.

AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1) Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3) Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction, totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUPID: Curating Data your Robot Loves with Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19121v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</p></details> |  |

We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively.

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

| **[HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15947v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) are emerging as a promising paradigm to support various low-altitude services through integrated air-ground infrastructure. To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Most common steering approaches, like goal-conditioning, require training the robot policy with a distribution of test-time objectives in mind. To overcome this limitation, we present DynaGuide, a steering method for diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the diffusion denoising process. DynaGuide separates the dynamics model from the base policy, which gives it multiple advantages, including the ability to steer towards multiple objectives, enhance underrepresented base policy behaviors, and maintain robustness on low-quality objectives. The separate guidance signal also allows DynaGuide to work with off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion policies. We demonstrate the performance and features of DynaGuide against other steering approaches in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing an average steering success of 70% on a set of articulated CALVIN tasks and outperforming goal-conditioning by 5.4x when steered with low-quality objectives. We also successfully steer an off-the-shelf real robot policy to express preference for particular objects and even create novel behavior.

| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |

This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[X-Sim: Cross-Embodiment Learning via Real-to-Sim-to-Real](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07096v3)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12678v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIME:Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02316v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text, 20 pages all included</p></details> |
| **[DemoSpeedup: Accelerating Visuomotor Policies via Entropy-Guided Demonstration Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05064v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand, robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable, high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and ease of adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Perception and Action: Spatially-Grounded Mid-Level Representations for Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06196v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11% higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more granular, actionable representations.

| **[Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04726v4)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods leverage previous experiences to learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RA-L with IROS presentation option (2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11612v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with a Gaussian policy has become a mainstream implementation for realizing the Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) objective, which incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration and enhance policy robustness. While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .</p></details> |  |
| **[Mini Diffuser: Fast Multi-task Diffusion Policy Training Using Two-level Mini-batches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method that reduces, by an order of magnitude, the time and memory needed to train multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: In image generation, the target is high-dimensional. By contrast, in action generation, the dimensionality of the target is comparatively small, and only the image condition is high-dimensional. Our approach, \emph{Mini Diffuser}, exploits this asymmetry by introducing \emph{two-level minibatching}, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rodrigues Network for Learning Robot Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02618v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.</p></details> | 4pages |
| **[3D Equivariant Visuomotor Policy Learning via Spherical Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16969v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant models have recently been shown to improve the data efficiency of diffusion policy by a significant margin. However, prior work that explored this direction focused primarily on point cloud inputs generated by multiple cameras fixed in the workspace. This type of point cloud input is not compatible with the now-common setting where the primary input modality is an eye-in-hand RGB camera like a GoPro. This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in SO(3) without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Our work is the first SO(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for robotic manipulation that works using only monocular RGB inputs.</p></details> |  |
