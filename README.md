| **[Reinforcing Action Policies by Prophesying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20633v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies excel in aligning language, perception, and robot control. However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://LogosRoboticsGroup.github.io/ProphRL</p></details> |
| **[ArtiBench and ArtiBrain: Benchmarking Generalizable Vision-Language Articulated Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20330v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GigaBrain-0: A World Model-Powered Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19430v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning-VLA: A Fast and General Vision-Language-Action Reasoning Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19912v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPS: Preserving Vision-Language Representations via Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling for Better Vision-Language-Action Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19878v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[GigaWorld-0: World Models as Data Engine to Empower Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19861v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gigaworld0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Perception and Action: A Hybrid-Modality Pipeline with Implicit Visual Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19859v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continually Evolving Skill Knowledge in Vision Language Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18085v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Language Models Can Parse Floor Plan Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12842v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) can simultaneously reason about images and texts to tackle many tasks, from visual question answering to image captioning. This paper focuses on map parsing, a novel task that is unexplored within the VLM context and particularly useful to mobile robots. Map parsing requires understanding not only the labels but also the geometric configurations of a map, i.e., what areas are like and how they are connected. To evaluate the performance of VLMs on map parsing, we prompt VLMs with floor plan maps to generate task plans for complex indoor navigation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable capability of VLMs in map parsing, with a success rate of 0.96 in tasks requiring a sequence of nine navigation actions, e.g., approaching and going through doors. Other than intuitive observations, e.g., VLMs do better in smaller maps and simpler navigation tasks, there was a very interesting observation that its performance drops in large open areas. We provide practical suggestions to address such challenges as validated by our experimental results. Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-floorplan/</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune-Then-Plan: Step-Level Calibration for Stable Frontier Exploration in Embodied Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19768v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://noahfrahm.github.io/Prune-Then-Plan-project-page/</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

| **[Rethinking Intermediate Representation for VLM-based Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19315v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Model (VLM) is an important component to enable robust robot manipulation. Yet, using it to translate human instructions into an action-resolvable intermediate representation often needs a tradeoff between VLM-comprehensibility and generalizability. Inspired by context-free grammar, we design the Semantic Assembly representation named SEAM, by decomposing the intermediate representation into vocabulary and grammar. Doing so leads us to a concise vocabulary of semantically-rich operations and a VLM-friendly grammar for handling diverse unseen tasks. In addition, we design a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with a retrieval-augmented few-shot learning strategy to localize fine-grained object parts for manipulation, effectively with the shortest inference time over all state-of-the-art parallel works. Also, we formulate new metrics for action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, demonstrating the compelling performance of SEAM over mainstream representations on both aspects. Extensive real-world experiments further manifest its SOTA performance under varying settings and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Percept-WAM: Perception-Enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model for Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19221v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models - generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions - are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency - capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce an evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks - action recognition and character recognition - each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a VLM-based evaluator for video world model rollouts adapted under data and compute constraints. In our extensive experiments totaling over 5,154 GPU-days, we explore full, partial, and parameter-efficient adaptation methods across various task formats, context lengths, sampling methods, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator achieves parity with task-specific checkpoints. Human studies across seven diverse environments confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a lightweight, adaptable, and semantics-aware evaluator for video world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS LAW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale image and text pretraining. However, existing VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, which may yield defective results. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly incorporates 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation model. This integration provides the model with depth-aware visual representations, improving its ability to understand the geometric structure of the scene and the spatial relationships among objects from RGB images alone. We evaluate our method on a set of spatially challenging tasks in both simulation and the real world. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action models with Active Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18960v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Compressor-VLA: Instruction-Guided Visual Token Compression for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18950v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Discover, Learn, and Reinforce: Scaling Vision-Language-Action Pretraining with Diverse RL-Generated Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19528v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling vision-language-action (VLA) model pre-training requires large volumes of diverse, high-quality manipulation trajectories. Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Existing Vision--Language Models (VLMs) struggle with generalization across heterogeneous platforms and lack precision in interface understanding and action execution. We introduce Yanyun-3, a VLM-based agent that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for visual reasoning and UI-TARS for interface execution. We propose a novel data organization principle -- combination granularity -- to distinguish intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing of multimodal data (static images, multi-image sequences, and videos). The model is fine-tuned using QLoRA on a curated dataset across three strategy game platforms. The optimal strategy (M*V+S) achieves a 12.98x improvement in BLEU-4 score and a 63% reduction in inference time compared to full fusion. Yanyun-3 successfully executes core tasks (e.g., target selection, resource allocation) across platforms without platform-specific tuning. Our findings demonstrate that structured multimodal data organization significantly enhances VLM performance in embodied tasks. Yanyun-3 offers a generalizable framework for GUI automation, with broader implications for robotics and autonomous systems.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[UNeMo: Collaborative Visual-Language Reasoning and Navigation via a Multimodal World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18845v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeVLA: Cross-Skill Model Merging Toward a Generalist Vision-Language-Action Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18810v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models reformulate vision-language models by tuning them with millions of robotic demonstrations. While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Task Transfer in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18787v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.</p></details> |  |

The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Task-aware Virtual View Exploration (TVVE), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating virtual view exploration with task-specific representation learning. TVVE employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Task-aware Mixture-of-Experts (TaskMoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TVVE generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. To further validate the robustness and generalization capability of TVVE under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, we construct a challenging benchmark, RLBench-OG, covering various visual perturbations and camera pose variations. Extensive experiments on RLBench and RLBench-OG show that our TVVE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. In real-robot experiments, TVVE demonstrates exceptional performance and generalizes robustly in multiple OOD settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions.

Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.</p></details> |  |

However, contemporary VLMs produce details that are inadequately aligned with the objectives of disaster assessment, primarily due to their deficiency in domain knowledge and the absence of a more refined descriptive process. This research presents the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a dedicated multimodal framework aimed at integrating external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to improve the captioning process. The objective is to produce disaster-specific descriptions that effectively convert raw visual data into actionable intelligence. VLCE utilizes two separate architectures: a CNN-LSTM model that incorporates a ResNet50 backbone, pretrained on EuroSat for satellite imagery (xBD dataset), and a Vision Transformer developed for UAV imagery (RescueNet dataset). In various architectural frameworks and datasets, VLCE exhibits a consistent advantage over baseline models such as LLaVA and QwenVL. Our optimal configuration reaches an impressive 95.33\% on InfoMetIC for UAV imagery while also demonstrating strong performance across satellite imagery. The proposed framework signifies a significant transition from basic visual classification to the generation of comprehensive situational intelligence, demonstrating immediate applicability for implementation in real-time disaster assessment systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://alexandrosstergiou.github.io/TRANSPORTER</p></details> |
| **[When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16203v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLAs are mostly confined to short-horizon, table-top manipulation, lacking the memory and reasoning capability required for long-horizon mobile manipulation, where agents must coordinate navigation and manipulation under changing spatial contexts. In this work, we present EchoVLA, a memory-aware VLA model for long-horizon mobile manipulation. EchoVLA incorporates a synergistic declarative memory inspired by the human brain, consisting of a scene memory that maintains a collection of spatial-semantic maps and an episodic memory that stores task-level experiences with multimodal contextual features. During both training and inference, the two memories are individually stored, updated, and retrieved based on current observations, task history, and instructions, and their retrieved representations are fused via coarse- and fine-grained attention to guide mobile-arm diffusion policies. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we further introduce MoMani, an automated benchmark that generates expert-level long-horizon trajectories through multimodal large language model (MLLM)-guided planning and feedback-driven refinement, supplemented with real-robot demonstrations. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that EchoVLA improves long-horizon performance, reaching 0.52 SR on manipulation/navigation and 0.31 on mobile manipulation, exceeding $π_{0.5}$ by +0.08 and +0.11.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to bridge high-level semantic reasoning and low-level actuation, leading to unstable grounding and weak generalization in the real world. To address these issues, we present MobileVLA-R1, a unified vision-language-action framework that enables explicit reasoning and continuous control for quadruped robots. We construct MobileVLA-CoT, a large-scale dataset of multi-granularity chain-of-thought (CoT) for embodied trajectories, providing structured reasoning supervision for alignment. Built upon this foundation, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm that combines supervised CoT alignment with GRPO reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning consistency, control stability, and long-horizon execution. Extensive evaluations on VLN and VLA tasks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with approximately a 5% improvement. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot validates robust performance in complex environments. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MobileVLA-R1.

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

OpenDriveVLA generates spatially grounded driving actions by leveraging multimodal inputs, including 2D and 3D instance-aware visual representations, ego vehicle states, and language commands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and language embeddings, we introduce a hierarchical vision language alignment process, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified semantic space. Furthermore, we incorporate structured agent environment ego interaction modeling into the autoregressive decoding process, enabling the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and behavior-aware dynamics critical for reliable trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OpenDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across open-loop trajectory planning and driving-related question answering tasks. Qualitative analyses further illustrate its capability to follow high-level driving commands and generate trajectories under challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for next-generation end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progress-Think: Semantic Progress Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17097v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation requires agents to act coherently over long horizons by understanding not only local visual context but also how far they have advanced within a multi-step instruction. However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[GhostEI-Bench: Do Mobile Agents Resilience to Environmental Injection in Dynamic On-Device Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20333v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Conte...</summary><p>Content: 8 pages 4 figures, conference paper under review</p></details> |

Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $π$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $π_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $π_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |

However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.</p></details> |  |

Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

| **[SRPO: Self-Referential Policy Optimization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15605v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SIGMME/IWR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look, Zoom, Understand: The Robotic Eyeball for Embodied Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15279v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Tracing of Object Representations in Large Vision Language Models: Mechanistic Interpretability and Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05923v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Oral |

To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Safe and Stable Neural Network Dynamical Systems S$^2$-NNDS, a learning-from-demonstration framework that simultaneously learns expressive neural dynamical systems alongside neural Lyapunov stability and barrier safety certificates. Unlike traditional approaches with restrictive polynomial parameterizations, S$^2$-NNDS leverages neural networks to capture complex robot motions providing probabilistic guarantees through split conformal prediction in learned certificates. Experimental results on various 2D and 3D datasets -- including LASA handwriting and demonstrations recorded kinesthetically from the Franka Emika Panda robot -- validate S$^2$-NNDS effectiveness in learning robust, safe, and stable motions from potentially unsafe demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

We present GUARDIAN (Gated Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants), a framework for real-time neuro-symbolic verification for neural signal-controlled robotics. GUARDIAN enforces both logical safety and physiological trust by coupling confidence-calibrated brain signal decoding with symbolic goal grounding and dual-layer runtime monitoring. On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41). We demonstrate 1.7x correct interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied and Safe-Assured Robotic Systems workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |
| **[How Robot Kinematics Influence Human Performance in Virtual Robot-to-Human Handover Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20299v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in robotics have increased the possibilities for integrating robotic systems into human-involved workplaces, highlighting the need to examine and optimize human-robot coordination in collaborative settings. This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafePR: Unified Approach for Safe Parallel Robots by Contact Detection and Reaction with Redundancy Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17773v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid self-collisions and type-II singularities. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward generic control for soft robotic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20226v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotics has advanced rapidly, yet its control methods remain fragmented: different morphologies and actuation schemes still require task-specific controllers, hindering theoretical integration and large-scale deployment. A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeForce: Low-Cost Soft Robotic Wrist for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19955v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact feedback is essential for contact-rich robotic manipulation, as it allows the robot to detect subtle interaction changes and adjust its actions accordingly. Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Perception and Action: A Hybrid-Modality Pipeline with Implicit Visual Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19859v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot-Powered Data Flywheels: Deploying Robots in the Wild for Continual Data Collection and Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19647v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FM) have unlocked powerful zero-shot capabilities in vision and language, yet their reliance on internet pretraining data leaves them brittle in unstructured, real-world settings. The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet, using it to translate human instructions into an action-resolvable intermediate representation often needs a tradeoff between VLM-comprehensibility and generalizability. Inspired by context-free grammar, we design the Semantic Assembly representation named SEAM, by decomposing the intermediate representation into vocabulary and grammar. Doing so leads us to a concise vocabulary of semantically-rich operations and a VLM-friendly grammar for handling diverse unseen tasks. In addition, we design a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with a retrieval-augmented few-shot learning strategy to localize fine-grained object parts for manipulation, effectively with the shortest inference time over all state-of-the-art parallel works. Also, we formulate new metrics for action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, demonstrating the compelling performance of SEAM over mainstream representations on both aspects. Extensive real-world experiments further manifest its SOTA performance under varying settings and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, current ISO/TS-15066-compliant implementations often limit the efficiency of collaborative tasks due to conservative speed restrictions. For this reason, this paper introduces a deep-learning-based human-robot-safety framework (HRSF) that aims at a dynamical adaptation of robot velocities depending on the separation distance between human and robot while respecting maximum biomechanical force and pressure limits. The applicability of the framework was investigated for four different deep learning approaches that can be used for human body extraction: human body recognition, human body segmentation, human pose estimation, and human body part segmentation. Unlike conventional industrial safety systems, the proposed HRSF differentiates individual human body parts from other objects, enabling optimized robot process execution. Experiments demonstrated a quantitative reduction in cycle time of up to 15% compared to conventional safety technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>MDPI ...</summary><p>MDPI Sensors, published 22 November 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving it efficiently remains a challenge. We address the problem of ensuring resilient robotic actions that can adapt to complex changes in object pose during human-to-robot object handovers. We propose the use of Virtual Model Control to create an interaction layer that controls the robot and adapts to the dynamic changes in the handover process. Additionally, we propose the use of augmented reality to facilitate bidirectional communication between humans and robots during handovers. We assess the performance of our controller in a set of experiments that demonstrate its resilience to various sources of uncertainties, including complex changes to the object's pose during the handover. Finally, we performed a user study with 16 participants to understand human preferences for different robot control profiles and augmented reality visuals in object handovers. Our results showed a general preference for the proposed approach and revealed insights that can guide further development in adapting the interaction with the user.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2R2: MultiModal Robotic Representation for Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18662v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries, with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast, computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras. Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models. Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

YORI integrates a dual-arm manipulator equipped with proprioceptive actuators, custom-designed tools, appliances, and a structured kitchen environment to address the complexities of cooking tasks. The proprioceptive actuators enable fast, precise, force-controlled movements while mitigating the risks associated with cooking-related impacts. The system's modular kitchen design and flexible tool-changing mechanism support simultaneous multi-dish preparation through torque control and optimization-based motion planning and scheduling. A comprehensive scheduling framework with dynamic rescheduling ensures reliable adaptation to new orders and delays. The system was publicly validated through live demonstrations, reliably preparing steak-frites across multiple convention sessions. This paper details YORI's design and explores future directions in kitchen optimization, task planning, and food quality control, demonstrating its potential as a scalable robotic cooking solution.

| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to See and Act: Task-Aware Virtual View Exploration for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05186v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-aware Virtual View Exploration (TVVE), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating virtual view exploration with task-specific representation learning. TVVE employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Task-aware Mixture-of-Experts (TaskMoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TVVE generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. To further validate the robustness and generalization capability of TVVE under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, we construct a challenging benchmark, RLBench-OG, covering various visual perturbations and camera pose variations. Extensive experiments on RLBench and RLBench-OG show that our TVVE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. In real-robot experiments, TVVE demonstrates exceptional performance and generalizes robustly in multiple OOD settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions.

| **[Head Stabilization for Wheeled Bipedal Robots via Force-Estimation-Based Admittance Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18712v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wheeled bipedal robots are emerging as flexible platforms for field exploration. However, head instability induced by uneven terrain can degrade the accuracy of onboard sensors or damage fragile payloads. Existing research primarily focuses on stabilizing the mobile platform but overlooks active stabilization of the head in the world frame, resulting in vertical oscillations that undermine overall stability. To address this challenge, we developed a model-based ground force estimation method for our 6-degree-of-freedom wheeled bipedal robot. Leveraging these force estimates, we implemented an admittance control algorithm to enhance terrain adaptability. Simulation experiments validated the real-time performance of the force estimator and the robot's robustness when traversing uneven terrain.</p></details> |  |
| **[GVD-TG: Topological Graph based on Fast Hierarchical GVD Sampling for Robot Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18708v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological maps are more suitable than metric maps for robotic exploration tasks. However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility. And the performance of system for exploration task is verified through comparative tests with SOTA methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Asynchronous Distributed Multi-Robot Motion Planning Under Imperfect Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18703v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of coordinating multi-robot systems under realistic communication delays using distributed optimization. We focus on consensus ADMM as a scalable framework for generating collision-free, dynamically feasible motion plans in both trajectory optimization and receding-horizon control settings. In practice, however, these algorithms are sensitive to penalty tuning or adaptation schemes (e.g. residual balancing and adaptive parameter heuristics) that do not explicitly consider delays. To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information. The proposed DA-ADMM achieves consistently better coordination performance across a wide range of delay conditions, offering a principled and efficient mechanism for resilient multi-robot motion planning under imperfect communication.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework, the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL), that integrates the advanced rendering capabilities of the Unreal Engine with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical to evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer.

Insights from a Multiple Case Study Approach to Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18561v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly utilised for diverse applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to security patrols. While USV technology is progressing, it remains clear that full autonomy is not achievable in all scenarios, and remote human intervention is still crucial, particularly in dynamic or complex environments. This continued reliance on human intervention highlights a range of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) challenges that remain unresolved. Compared to the extensive body of HRI research in domains such as unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous vehicles, HRI considerations specific to USVs remain significantly underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study investigates real-world usability challenges in USV operation through in-depth interviews with 9 engineers and users, supported by field observations. We focus especially on the difficulties beginner operators encounter and their coping strategies. Our findings reveal existing usability issues, mental models, and adaptation strategies of beginners that inform future user-centered design of USV systems, contributing new insights to the emerging field of maritime HRI. Based on these findings, we argue that current USV systems are poorly suited for beginner operation in dynamic inland and offshore environments, where operators must make timely decisions under uncertainty, manage complex spatial awareness, and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we identify key operational patterns in three representative use cases-harmful algal bloom detection, underwater concealed pipe inspection and post-construction hydrographic survey, and summarise key interaction constraints that should inform future maritime HRI design efforts.</p></details> |  |

Our method fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics. Updated online, this field enables semantic reasoning to distinguish traversable vegetation (e.g., tall grass) from rigid obstacles (e.g., trees), while LiDAR ensures 360-degree geometric coverage for extended planning horizons. We validate Splatblox on a quadruped robot and demonstrate transfer to a wheeled platform. In field trials across vegetation-rich scenarios, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 50% higher success rate, 40% fewer freezing incidents, 5% shorter paths, and up to 13% faster time to goal, while supporting long-range missions up to 100 meters.

To address this critical barrier to real-world deployment, we present \method, a framework that learns to predict imminent, unavoidable falls and execute protective maneuvers to minimize hardware damage. SafeFall is designed to operate seamlessly alongside existing nominal controller, ensuring no interference during normal operation. It combines two synergistic components: a lightweight, GRU-based fall predictor that continuously monitors the robot's state, and a reinforcement learning policy for damage mitigation. The protective policy remains dormant until the predictor identifies a fall as unavoidable, at which point it activates to take control and execute a damage-minimizing response. This policy is trained with a novel, damage-aware reward function that incorporates the robot's specific structural vulnerabilities, learning to shield critical components like the head and hands while absorbing energy with more robust parts of its body. Validated on a full-scale Unitree G1 humanoid, SafeFall demonstrated significant performance improvements over unprotected falls. It reduced peak contact forces by 68.3\%, peak joint torques by 78.4\%, and eliminated 99.3\% of collisions with vulnerable components. By enabling humanoids to fail safely, SafeFall provides a crucial safety net that allows for more aggressive experiments and accelerates the deployment of these robots in complex, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Visually Interpretable Oscillator Networks for Soft Continuum Robots from Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18322v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of soft continuum robot (SCR) dynamics from high-dimensional observations offers flexibility but often lacks physical interpretability, while model-based approaches require prior knowledge and can be computationally expensive. We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.</p></details> |  |

However, previous NeRF-based reconstruction methods overlook the critical role of acoustic impedance in ultrasound imaging. Localization methods face challenges related to local minima due to the selection of initial poses. In this study, we design a robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) with an acoustic-impedance-aware ultrasound NeRF (AIA-UltraNeRF) to decouple the scanning and diagnostic processes. Specifically, AIA-UltraNeRF models a continuous function of hash-encoded spatial coordinates for the 3D ultrasound map, allowing for the storage of acoustic impedance without dense sampling. This approach accelerates both reconstruction and inference speeds. We then propose a dual-supervised network that leverages teacher and student models to hash-encode the rendered ultrasound images from the reconstructed map. AIA-UltraNeRF retrieves the most similar hash values without the need to render images again, providing an offline initial image position for localization. Moreover, we develop a RUSS with a spherical remote center of motion mechanism to hold the probe, implementing operator-independent scanning modes that separate image acquisition from diagnostic workflows. Experimental results on a phantom and human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of acoustic impedance in implicitly characterizing the color of ultrasound images. AIAUltraNeRF achieves both reconstruction and localization with inference speeds that are 9.9 faster than those of vanilla NeRF.</p></details> |  |
| **[AFT: Appearance-Based Feature Tracking for Markerless and Training-Free Shape Reconstruction of Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18215v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate shape reconstruction is essential for precise control and reliable operation of soft robots. Compared to sensor-based approaches, vision-based methods offer advantages in cost, simplicity, and ease of deployment. However, existing vision-based methods often rely on complex camera setups, specific backgrounds, or large-scale training datasets, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that directly leverages the robot's natural surface appearance. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for reliable, low-cost deployment in dynamic real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Creative AI Track</p></details> |

However, existing VLAs are mostly confined to short-horizon, table-top manipulation, lacking the memory and reasoning capability required for long-horizon mobile manipulation, where agents must coordinate navigation and manipulation under changing spatial contexts. In this work, we present EchoVLA, a memory-aware VLA model for long-horizon mobile manipulation. EchoVLA incorporates a synergistic declarative memory inspired by the human brain, consisting of a scene memory that maintains a collection of spatial-semantic maps and an episodic memory that stores task-level experiences with multimodal contextual features. During both training and inference, the two memories are individually stored, updated, and retrieved based on current observations, task history, and instructions, and their retrieved representations are fused via coarse- and fine-grained attention to guide mobile-arm diffusion policies. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we further introduce MoMani, an automated benchmark that generates expert-level long-horizon trajectories through multimodal large language model (MLLM)-guided planning and feedback-driven refinement, supplemented with real-robot demonstrations. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that EchoVLA improves long-horizon performance, reaching 0.52 SR on manipulation/navigation and 0.31 on mobile manipulation, exceeding $π_{0.5}$ by +0.08 and +0.11.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Multi-Dynamics Framework for Perception-Oriented Modeling in Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18088v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tendon-driven continuum robots offer intrinsically safe and contact-rich interactions owing to their kinematic redundancy and structural compliance. However, their perception often depends on external sensors, which increase hardware complexity and limit scalability. This work introduces a unified multi-dynamics modeling framework for tendon-driven continuum robotic systems, exemplified by a spiral-inspired robot named Spirob. The framework integrates motor electrical dynamics, motor-winch dynamics, and continuum robot dynamics into a coherent system model. Within this framework, motor signals such as current and angular displacement are modeled to expose the electromechanical signatures of external interactions, enabling perception grounded in intrinsic dynamics. The model captures and validates key physical behaviors of the real system, including actuation hysteresis and self-contact at motion limits. Building on this foundation, the framework is applied to environmental interaction: first for passive contact detection, verified experimentally against simulation data; then for active contact sensing, where control and perception strategies from simulation are successfully applied to the real robot; and finally for object size estimation, where a policy learned in simulation is directly deployed on hardware. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a physically grounded way to interpret interaction signatures from intrinsic motor signals in tendon-driven continuum robots.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, real-world arm motion is noisy, and the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model it, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality.

Existing methods struggle to bridge high-level semantic reasoning and low-level actuation, leading to unstable grounding and weak generalization in the real world. To address these issues, we present MobileVLA-R1, a unified vision-language-action framework that enables explicit reasoning and continuous control for quadruped robots. We construct MobileVLA-CoT, a large-scale dataset of multi-granularity chain-of-thought (CoT) for embodied trajectories, providing structured reasoning supervision for alignment. Built upon this foundation, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm that combines supervised CoT alignment with GRPO reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning consistency, control stability, and long-horizon execution. Extensive evaluations on VLN and VLA tasks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with approximately a 5% improvement.

In our iterative workflow, human safety requirements are translated by regulators into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Rollout traces from the black-box model are externally verified for compliance, yielding quantitative safety metrics, Total Robustness Value (TRV) and Largest Robustness Value (LRV), which measure average and worst-case specification adherence. These metrics inform targeted retraining and iterative improvement by model designers. We apply our method across two different applications: a virtual driving scenario and an autonomous mobile robot navigating a complex environment, and observe statistically significant improvements across both scenarios. In the virtual driving scenario, we see a 177% increase in traces adhering to the simulation speed limit, a 1138% increase in traces minimizing off-road driving, and a 16% increase in traces successfully reaching the goal within the time limit. In the autonomous navigation scenario, there is a 300% increase in traces avoiding sharp turns, a 200% increase in traces reaching the goal within the time limit, and a 49% increase in traces minimizing time spent near obstacles. Finally, we validate our approach on a TurtleBot3 robot in the real world, and demonstrate improved obstacle navigation with safety buffers.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the performance and robustness of diffusion policy learning as a promising solution for contact-sensitive robotic assembly at construction scale, using timber mortise and tenon joints as a case study. A two-phase study is conducted: first, to evaluate policy performance and applicability; second, to assess robustness in handling fabrication uncertainties simulated as randomized perturbations to the mortise position. The best-performing policy achieved a total average success rate of 75% with perturbations up to 10 mm, including 100% success in unperturbed cases. The results demonstrate the potential of sensory-motor diffusion policies to generalize to a wide range of complex, contact-rich assembly tasks across construction and manufacturing, advancing robotic construction under uncertainty and contributing to safer, more efficient building practices.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise.

To address the challenge, we present RoboCOIN, a comprehensive multi-embodiment bimanual manipulation dataset with over 180,000 demonstrations collected from 15 distinct robotic platforms.

| **[SPEAR-1: Scaling Beyond Robot Demonstrations via 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17411v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feasibility of Embodied Dynamics Based Bayesian Learning for Continuous Pursuit Motion Control of Assistive Mobile Robots in the Built Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17401v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an intuitive means for individuals with severe motor impairments to independently operate assistive robotic wheelchairs and navigate built environments. Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 9 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |

We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

A timely and motivating engineering application is how autonomous vehicles interpret ambiguous right-of-way such as unsignalized pedestrian crossings. To address this challenge, this study explores the feasibility of decoding preparatory neural activity from wearable electroencephalography (EEG) to predict human motion intention before it is behaviorally expressed. Drawing inspiration from biological predictive coding mechanisms between the sensorimotor cortex and insula-frontoparietal network, we implement this principle in a Temporal Convolutional Network-Transformer architecture to decode fast-evolving EEG signals underlying perception-action transitions. In experiments involving twelve participants simulating road-crossing decisions under varying traffic volume, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals, neurophysiological analyses reveal hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization and identify high-beta oscillations (16-25 Hz) in the right fronto-central region (F4) as robust neural markers of motor readiness and decision commitment. Using sliding-window feature extraction, we benchmarked sixteen classification models across traditional, recurrent, and convolutional deep learning architectures, and found that our approach achieved the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.727 with an approximate 1-second look-ahead. This work demonstrates how biologically grounded temporal architectures can enhance anticipatory intelligence in autonomous systems and represents the first step toward proactive and adaptive human-robot interaction in the built environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Robot Design with Multi-Objective Black-Box Optimization and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17178v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various methods for robot design optimization have been developed so far. These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-GAR: A Hierarchical Interaction Framework via Goal-Driven Observation-Action Refinement for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17079v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified video and action prediction models hold great potential for robotic manipulation, as future observations offer contextual cues for planning, while actions reveal how interactions shape the environment. However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/H-GAR</p></details> |

| **[LocateAnything3D: Vision-Language 3D Detection with Chain-of-Sight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20648v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[Vision-Language Memory for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20644v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is a critical capability for intelligent robots, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) still fall short of human-level performance in video-based spatial reasoning. This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information. This design enables efficient and long-horizon spatial reasoning with a fixed computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance among video-only models, significantly advancing the frontier of visual-spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Aware Batch Sampling Improves Language-Image Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20643v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Vision-Language Models for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20641v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing Action Policies by Prophesying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20633v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies excel in aligning language, perception, and robot control. However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://LogosRoboticsGroup.github.io/ProphRL</p></details> |

The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components. REACT (Requirements Engineering with AI for Consistency and Testing) employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between informal natural language requirements and formal specifications, enabling early verification and validation. SemaLens (Semantic Analysis of Visual Perception using large Multi-modal models) utilizes Vision Language Models (VLMs) to reason about, test, and monitor DNN-based perception systems using human-understandable concepts. Together, these components provide a comprehensive pipeline from informal requirements to validated implementations.</p></details> |  |

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster at NewInML Workshop ICML, 2025</p></details> |
| **[ExDDV: A New Dataset for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14421v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever growing realism and quality of generated videos makes it increasingly harder for humans to spot deepfake content, who need to rely more and more on automatic deepfake detectors. However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts. Our novel dataset and code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Adam Simplified: Bias Correction Simplified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20516v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adam optimizer is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet the empirical necessity of each of its individual components is often taken for granted. This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.</p></details> |  |
| **[NVIDIA Nemotron Parse 1.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20478v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Nemotron-Parse-1.1, a lightweight document parsing and OCR model that advances the capabilities of its predecessor, Nemoretriever-Parse-1.0. Nemotron-Parse-1.1 delivers improved capabilities across general OCR, markdown formatting, structured table parsing, and text extraction from pictures, charts, and diagrams. It also supports a longer output sequence length for visually dense documents. As with its predecessor, it extracts bounding boxes of text segments, as well as corresponding semantic classes. Nemotron-Parse-1.1 follows an encoder-decoder architecture with 885M parameters, including a compact 256M-parameter language decoder. It achieves competitive accuracy on public benchmarks making it a strong lightweight OCR solution. We release the model weights publicly on Huggingface, as well as an optimized NIM container, along with a subset of the training data as part of the broader Nemotron-VLM-v2 dataset. Additionally, we release Nemotron-Parse-1.1-TC which operates on a reduced vision token length, offering a 20% speed improvement with minimal quality degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[When to Think and When to Look: Uncertainty-Guided Lookback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15613v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Vision Token Pruning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20439v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.</p></details> |  |
| **[VibraVerse: A Large-Scale Geometry-Acoustics Alignment Dataset for Physically-Consistent Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20422v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06836v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and sensor-based condition monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal understanding capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual understanding tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pre-trained vision encoder, which leverages 2D time series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM's visual understanding capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pre-trained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6% improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36x more efficient in token usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |
| **[NNGPT: Rethinking AutoML with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20333v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose an iterative self-refinement framework that leverages large language models and vision-language models to provide physics-aware guidance for video generation. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38. We hope this work serves as a preliminary exploration of physics-consistent video generation and may offer insights for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Physics-IQ Challenge Third Place Solution</p></details> |

This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data & Code: this https URL</p></details> |
| **[V-Attack: Targeting Disentangled Value Features for Controllable Adversarial Attacks on LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20223v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

| **[In-Context Compositional Learning via Sparse Coding Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20194v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

| **[Can Modern Vision Models Understand the Difference Between an Object and a Look-alike?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19200v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Models for Automated 3D PET/CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20145v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym will be released.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2026.

Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art overall performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks and attains comparable results to the leading approaches on image captioning benchmarks.</p></details> | Under Review |

When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes," geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D settings. To alleviate these limitations, we propose TK-Mamba, a multimodal framework that fuses the linear-time Mamba with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to form an efficient hybrid backbone. Our approach is characterized by two primary technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce the novel 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN), which marks the first application of KAN in 3D medical imaging, providing a superior and computationally efficient nonlinear feature transformation crucial for complex volumetric structures. Secondly, we devise a dual-branch text-driven strategy using Pubmedclip's embeddings. This strategy significantly enhances segmentation robustness and accuracy by simultaneously capturing inter-organ semantic relationships to mitigate label inconsistencies and aligning image features with anatomical texts. By combining this advanced backbone and vision-language knowledge, TK-Mamba offers a unified and scalable solution for both multi-organ and tumor segmentation. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both organ and tumor segmentation tasks, surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

| **[EmoFeedback2: Reinforcement of Continuous Emotional Image Generation via LVLM-based Reward and Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19982v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset.

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to accurately understand driving scenes and generate trustworthy trajectories. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT integrates a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, which is trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a k-means & HNSW retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Retrieved prior knowledge is added into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning paradigm aligns the VLM backbone to enhance spatial perception and trajectory prediction capabilities. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves the best open-loop performance compared with baseline methods. Ablation studies on fine-tuning stages, Top-K value of RAG, different retrieval strategies, vision encoders, and VLM backbones are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of KEPT. These results indicate that KEPT offers a promising, data-efficient way toward trustworthy trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K).

However, SAFL faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD) and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL. FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their local training based on data distribution characteristics and available computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning.

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks.

The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-VLA: A Fast and General Vision-Language-Action Reasoning Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19912v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent0-VL: Exploring Self-Evolving Agent for Tool-Integrated Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19900v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Cross-Modal Knowledge via Feature Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19887v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

A Comprehensive Benchmark for Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20426v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions.

However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

To simplify the learning paradigm, most previous methods convert ambiguous annotation results into precise one-hot annotations and train FER models in an end-to-end supervised manner. In this paper, we rethink the existing training paradigm and propose that it is better to use weakly supervised strategies to train FER models with original ambiguous annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Vision-Language Models for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20641v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.</p></details> |  |

A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing Action Policies by Prophesying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20633v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies excel in aligning language, perception, and robot control. However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://LogosRoboticsGroup.github.io/ProphRL</p></details> |

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models.

In recent years, focus has intensified on social determinants of health, highlighting the need for methods that account for patients' locations. We propose a Bayesian approach for introducing point-referenced spatial effects into a competing risks proportional hazards model. Our method leverages Gaussian process (GP) priors for spatially varying intercept and slope. To improve computational efficiency under a large number of spatial locations, we implemented a Hilbert space low-rank approximation of the GP. We modeled the baseline hazard curves as piecewise constant, and introduced a novel multiplicative gamma process prior to induce shrinkage and smoothing. A loss-based clustering method was then used on the spatial random effects to identify high-risk regions. We demonstrate the utility of this method through simulation and a real-world analysis of EHR data from Duke Hospital to study readmission risk of elderly patients with upper extremity fractures. Our results showed that the proposed method improved inference efficiency and provided valuable insights for downstream policy decisions.</p></details> |  |

An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament on Market-driven Strategic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20613v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

A Cost-Effective Approach Using Active Learning Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20605v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive analytics applications. This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for optimising data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as a preprint. 34 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, existing multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs. Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1) unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5) multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.</p></details> | 4 figures, 2 tables |

Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaTAS: A Parallel System for Trust Propagation in Neural Networks Using Subjective Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20586v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \emph{Trust Nodes} and \emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20577v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

To also bring this capability to open-source models, we introduce VQ-VA World, a data-centric framework built around an agentic pipeline for large-scale, targeted data construction. Leveraging web-scale deployment, this pipeline crawls a massive amount of ~1.8M high-quality, interleaved image-text samples for model training. For evaluation, we further release IntelligentBench, a human-curated benchmark that systematically assesses VQ-VA along the aspects of world knowledge, design knowledge, and reasoning. Training with VQ-VA World data yields strong empirical gains: it helps LightFusion attain 53.06 on IntelligentBench, substantially surpassing the best prior open-source baselines (i.e., 7.78 from vanilla LightFusion; 1.94 from UniWorld-V1), and significantly narrowing the gap toward leading proprietary systems (e.g., 81.67 from NanoBanana; 82.64 from GPT-Image). By releasing the full suite of model weights, datasets, and pipelines, we hope to stimulate future research on VQ-VA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical Evaluation of Quantum Machine Learning for Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14989v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computational principles into learning algorithms, offering improved representational capacity and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the security and robustness of QML systems remain underexplored, especially under adversarial conditions. In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment. These insights underscore the importance of designing threat-aware models that remain reliable under real-world noise in NISQ settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20558v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.</p></details> |  |

This calls for an urgent need to understand how toxic content spreads and how it might be mitigated on online social networks, and expectedly has been the topic of extensive research in recent times. Prior work has largely modelled hate through epidemic or spread activation based diffusion models, in which the users are often divided into two categories, hateful or not. In this work, users are treated as transformers of toxicity, based on how they respond to incoming toxicity. Compared with the incoming toxicity, users amplify, attenuate, or replicate (effectively, transform) the toxicity and send it forward. We do a temporal analysis of toxicity on Twitter, Koo and Gab and find that (a) toxicity is not conserved in the network; (b) only a subset of users change behaviour over time; and (c) there is no evidence of homophily among behaviour-changing users. In our model, each user transforms incoming toxicity by applying a "shift" to it prior to sending it forward. Based on this, we develop a network model of toxicity spread that incorporates time-varying behaviour of users. We find that the "shift" applied by a user is dependent on the input toxicity and the category. Based on this finding, we propose an intervention strategy for toxicity reduction. This is simulated by deploying peace-bots. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks, we demonstrate that peace-bot interventions can reduce toxicity, though their effectiveness depends on network structure and placement strategy.</p></details> |  |

We present a comparative study of U-Net architectures, using various convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders, for pixel-level crack identification on statues and monuments. A comparative quantitative evaluation is performed on the test set of the OmniCrack30k dataset [1] using popular segmentation metrics including Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index. This is complemented by an out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on an unlabeled test set of real-world cracked statues and monuments. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of different CNN- based encoders for fine-grained crack segmentation. We show that the models exhibit promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts, despite never having been explicitly trained on images of statues or monuments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Cultural Heritage, Monitoring, Deep Learning, U-Nets, Semantic Segmentation</p></details> |

| **[Flexible unimodal density estimation in hidden Markov models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17071v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modelling time-series data with underlying state structure. However, selecting appropriate parametric forms for the state-dependent distributions is often challenging and can lead to model misspecification. To address this, P-spline-based nonparametric estimation of state-dependent densities has been proposed. While offering great flexibility, these approaches can result in overly complex densities (e.g. bimodal) that hinder interpretability. 2. We propose a straightforward method that builds on shape-constrained spline theory to enforce unimodality in the estimated state-dependent densities through enforcing unimodality of the spline coefficients. This constraint strikes a practical balance between model flexibility, interpretability, and parsimony. 3. Through two simulation studies and a real-world case study using narwhal (Monodon monoceros) dive data, we demonstrate the proposed approach yields more stable estimates compared to fully flexible, unconstrained models improving model performance and interpretability. 4. Our method bridges a key methodological gap, by providing a parsimonious HMM framework that balances the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric estimation. This provides ecologists with a powerful tool to derive ecologically meaningful inference from telemetry data while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |
| **[FRAGMENTA: End-to-end Fragmentation-based Generative Model with Agentic Tuning for Drug Lead Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20510v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a "vocabulary selection" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ranking-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Using Active Learning-Assisted Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20480v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models. Code and generated samples are available at https://github.com/apple/ml-starflow.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Towards Trustworthy Wi-Fi Sensing: Systematic Evaluation of Deep Learning Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20456v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments. This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Current detection methods face two major limitations: (1) the lack of multidimensional explainable datasets for generated images and videos. Existing open-source datasets (e.g., WildFake, GenVideo) rely on oversimplified binary annotations, which restrict the explainability and trustworthiness of trained detectors. (2) Prior MLLM-based forgery detectors (e.g., FakeVLM) exhibit insufficiently fine-grained interpretability in their step-by-step reasoning, which hinders reliable localization and explanation. To address these challenges, we introduce Ivy-Fake, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark for explainable AIGC detection. It consists of over 106K richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 5,000 manually verified evaluation examples, sourced from multiple generative models and real world datasets through a carefully designed pipeline to ensure both diversity and quality. Furthermore, we propose Ivy-xDetector, a reinforcement learning model based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), capable of producing explainable reasoning chains and achieving robust performance across multiple synthetic content detection benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our dataset and confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our method improves performance on GenImage from 86.88% to 96.32%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Haptic technologies involve complex cross-disciplinary research that encompasses sensing, data representation, interactive rendering, perception, and quality of experience. The standard processing pipeline, consists of (I) sensing physical features in the real world using a transducer, (II) modeling and storing the collected information in some digital format, (III) communicating the information, and finally, (IV) rendering the haptic information through appropriate devices, thus producing a user experience (V) perceptually close to the original physical world. Among these areas, sensing, rendering and perception have been deeply investigated and are the subject of different comprehensive surveys available in the literature. Differently, research dealing with haptic surface modeling and data representation still lacks a comprehensive dissection. In this work, we aim at providing an overview on modeling and representation of haptic surfaces from a signal processing perspective, covering the aspects that lie in between haptic information acquisition on one side and rendering and perception on the other side. We analyze, categorize, and compare research papers that address the haptic surface modeling and data representation, pointing out existing gaps and possible research directions.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics-based simulator for granular materials using the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by demonstrations generated through gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials within our simulator, eliminating the costly data collection and model training of prior methods.

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.</p></details> |  |

To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Robust 5G Terrestrial Positioning System with Sensor Fusion in GNSS-denied Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16600v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a terrestrial localization system based on 5G infrastructure as a viable alternative to GNSS, particularly in scenarios where GNSS signals are obstructed or unavailable. It discusses network planning aimed at enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional focus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network infrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that leverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to localize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs) provide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning requires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution, LOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions. To this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates the need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep learning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the trilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes unreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to fuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving users across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed terrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset, featuring a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show that the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the KITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS services--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Accurate Graph Reasoning with LLM-based Multi-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05130v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling complex graph reasoning tasks. However, due to the intricacies of graph structures and the inherent limitations of LLMs in handling long text, current approaches often fail to deliver satisfactory accuracy, even on small-scale graphs and simple tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphAgent-Reasoner, a fine-tuning-free framework that utilizes a multi-agent collaboration strategy for explicit and precise graph reasoning. Inspired by distributed graph computation theory, our framework decomposes graph problems into smaller, node-centric tasks that are distributed among multiple agents. The agents collaborate to solve the overall problem, significantly reducing the amount of information and complexity handled by a single LLM, thus enhancing the accuracy of graph reasoning. By simply increasing the number of agents, GraphAgent-Reasoner can efficiently scale to accommodate larger graphs with over 1,000 nodes. Evaluated on the GraphInstruct dataset, our framework demonstrates near-perfect accuracy on polynomial-time graph reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming the best available models, both closed-source and fine-tuned open-source variants. Our framework also demonstrates the capability to handle real-world graph reasoning applications such as webpage importance analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop WMAC</p></details> |
| **[Improving Language Agents through BREW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20297v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[APT-CGLP: Advanced Persistent Threat Hunting via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20290v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Provenance-based threat hunting identifies Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on endpoints by correlating attack patterns described in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with provenance graphs derived from system audit logs. A fundamental challenge in this paradigm lies in the modality gap -- the structural and semantic disconnect between provenance graphs and CTI reports. Prior work addresses this by framing threat hunting as a graph matching task: 1) extracting attack graphs from CTI reports, and 2) aligning them with provenance graphs. However, this pipeline incurs severe \textit{information loss} during graph extraction and demands intensive manual curation, undermining scalability and effectiveness. In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention. First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility. Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world APT datasets demonstrate that APT-CGLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art threat hunting baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2026 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Lower Bias, Higher Welfare: How Creator Competition Reshapes Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Recommendation Platforms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20289v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff in user representation learning is essential for improving recommendation quality in modern content platforms. While well studied in static settings, this tradeoff becomes significantly more complex when content creators strategically adapt to platform incentives. To analyze how such competition reshapes the tradeoff for maximizing user welfare, we introduce the Content Creator Competition with Bias-Variance Tradeoff framework, a tractable game-theoretic model that captures the platform's decision on regularization strength in user feature estimation. We derive and compare the platform's optimal policy under two key settings: a non-strategic baseline with fixed content and a strategic environment where creators compete in response to the platform's algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis in a stylized model shows that, compared to the non-strategic environment, content creator competition shifts the platform's optimal policy toward weaker regularization, thereby favoring lower bias in the bias-variance tradeoff. To validate and assess the robustness of these insights beyond the stylized setting, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The empirical results consistently support our theoretical conclusion: in strategic environments, reducing bias leads to higher user welfare. These findings offer practical implications for the design of real-world recommendation algorithms in the presence of content creator competition.</p></details> | KDD 2026 |
| **[SMoG: Schema Matching on Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20285v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schema matching is a critical task in data integration, particularly in the medical domain where disparate Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems must be aligned to standard models like OMOP CDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Physics-Grounded Video Generation through VLM-Guided Iterative Self-Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20280v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in video generation has led to impressive visual quality, yet current models still struggle to produce results that align with real-world physical principles. To this end, we propose an iterative self-refinement framework that leverages large language models and vision-language models to provide physics-aware guidance for video generation. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38. We hope this work serves as a preliminary exploration of physics-consistent video generation and may offer insights for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Physics-IQ Challenge Third Place Solution</p></details> |
| **[More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[ScenarioCLIP: Pretrained Transferable Visual Language Models and Action-Genome Dataset for Natural Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20274v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP</p></details> |  |
| **[VKnowU: Evaluating Visual Knowledge Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20272v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles. This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data & Code: this https URL</p></details> |

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report |

This study proposes a physics-guided, interpretable-by-design spatiotemporal learning framework. The model decomposes the spatiotemporal behavior of air pollutant concentrations into two transparent, additive modules. The first is a physics-guided transport kernel with directed weights conditioned on wind and geography (advection). The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons. Our model's integration of high predictive performance and spatiotemporal interpretability provides a more reliable foundation for operational air-quality management in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |
