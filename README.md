| **[PostAlign: Multimodal Grounding as a Corrective Lens for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17901v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Untamed: Graph-Based Knowledge Retrieval and Reasoning for MLLMs to Conquer the Unknown](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17589v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[LEGO-Puzzles: How Good Are MLLMs at Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19990v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10912v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to MLLMs to Agents: A Survey of Emerging Paradigms in Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses within LLM Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15170v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASCD: Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding for Reducing Hallucination in MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14766v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) often suffer from hallucinations. They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Exploring MLLMs Perception of Network Visualization Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14611v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we test whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can match human-subject performance in tasks involving the perception of properties in network layouts. Specifically, we replicate a human-subject experiment about perceiving quality (namely stress) in network layouts using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception. Explanations from the models provide descriptions similar to those used by the human participants (e.g., even distribution of nodes and uniform edge lengths).</p></details> |  |
| **[PunchBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Multimodal Punchline Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11906v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal punchlines, which involve humor or sarcasm conveyed in image-caption pairs, are a popular way of communication on online multimedia platforms. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the camera-ready version for ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LingoLoop Attack: Trapping MLLMs via Linguistic Context and State Entrapment into Endless Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14493v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise but require substantial computational resources during inference. Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment. The code will be released publicly following the paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOP: Learning Optimal Pruning for Efficient On-Demand MLLMs Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12826v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose LOP, an efficient neural pruning framework that learns optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Will Pre-Training Ever End? A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v6)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time computation and post-training optimization, largely due to concerns over the availability of high-quality human data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient to drive substantial model improvements. We argue that effective model advancement requires strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time computation, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description for step-by-step visual understanding and integrate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced models then generate candidate image captions and CoT reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are filtered through a semantic-similarity-guided self-consistency mechanism. These high-quality, self-generated samples enable large-scale multimodal pre-training, creating a self-improvement loop. Experiments demonstrate SIcog's effectiveness in developing MLLMs with enhanced multimodal cognition. Using only 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog achieves significant improvements, including +3.6% on MMStar and +3.5% on AI2D, outperforming previous pre-training approaches. When combined with post-training techniques for CoT reasoning, SIcog yields +9% gains on MMVet and +8.5% on ScienceQA.</p></details> | 43 pages. Preprint |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. It serves as an essential testing ground for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work, we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex real-world vision-language tasks. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/sleepyshep/FineCops-Ref.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT).

| **[Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 82 pages |
| **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, code: https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner, project page: https://theia-4869.github.io/CDPruner</p></details> |
| **[ViC-Bench: Benchmarking Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Capability in MLLMs with Free-Style Intermediate State Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14404v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AD^2-Bench: A Hierarchical CoT Benchmark for MLLM in Autonomous Driving under Adverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09557v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Multimodal Large Language Model Truly Unlearn? Stealthy MLLM Unlearning Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17265v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Interpretable and Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images via Grounded Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07045v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations. However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging MLLM Embeddings and Attribute Smoothing for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12584v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects learned from seen compositions. Previous works disentangle attributes and objects by extracting shared and exclusive parts between the image pair sharing the same attribute (object), as well as aligning them with pretrained word embeddings to improve unseen attribute-object recognition. Despite the significant achievements of existing efforts, they are hampered by three limitations: (1) The efficacy of disentanglement is compromised due to the influence of the background and the intricate entanglement of attributes with objects in the same parts. (2) Existing word embeddings fail to capture complex multimodal semantic information. (3) Overconfidence exhibited by existing models in seen compositions hinders their generalization to novel compositions. Being aware of these, we propose a novel framework named multimodal large language model (MLLM) embeddings and attribute smoothing guided disentanglement for CZSL. First, we leverage feature adaptive aggregation modules to mitigate the impact of background, and utilize learnable condition masks to capture multi-granularity features for disentanglement. Moreover, the last hidden states of MLLM are employed as word embeddings for their superior representation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose attribute smoothing with auxiliary attributes generated by the large language model (LLM) for seen compositions to address the overconfidence challenge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets.

| **[Guiding Cross-Modal Representations with MLLM Priors via Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06970v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Clari...</summary><p>Clarification note for the CVPR 2025 paper (FarSight).

A Benchmark Study on Fine-Grained Visual Reasoning from Transit Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18675v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Robot Safety via MLLM-Based Semantic Interpretation of Failure Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06570v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments, ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants, they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal latent patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can be employed for online failure detection, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues. (3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS, and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair) in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated front-end development.

| **[MATP-BENCH: Can MLLM Be a Good Automated Theorem Prover for Multimodal Problems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06034v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal, Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056 multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research on automated theorem proving.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Modality-Fair Preference Optimization for Trustworthy MLLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15334v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05344v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.</p></details> | 32pages |

Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, ACL 2025 |
| **[MokA: Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05191v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration.

| **[Vision Remember: Alleviating Visual Forgetting in Efficient MLLM with Vision Feature Resample](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03928v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model. Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \& Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$, including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology, from training data to reasoning mechanisms, influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains.

However, existing approaches often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2) refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction. The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs, with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K: +4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in K12 scenarios are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method, resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring 33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable MLLMs.We open our resources at https://github.com/lichongod/K12Vista.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks fail to adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities; and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns, highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method} establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in original base models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Benchmark for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00893v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

| **[Improve MLLM Benchmark Efficiency through Interview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00883v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.</p></details> |  |

We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable Image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.

| **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLRC: Reinforcement Learning-based Recovery for Compressed Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17639v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs.

| **[VLA-OS: Structuring and Dissecting Planning Representations and Paradigms in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17561v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClutterDexGrasp: A Sim-to-Real System for General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14317v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes presents significant challenges due to diverse object geometries, occlusions, and potential collisions. Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulation manipulation.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Existing methods for few-shot manipulation often rely on simulation-augmented data or pre-built modules like grasping and pose estimation, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and lack extensibility. While large-scale imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting these general-purpose policies to specific tasks in data-scarce settings remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose ControlVLA, a novel framework that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric representations via a ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, to introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge, ControlVLA zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to gradually adapt the pre-trained manipulation policies. In real-world experiments across 6 diverse tasks, including pouring cubes and folding clothes, our method achieves a 76.7% success rate while requiring only 10-20 demonstrations -- a significant improvement over traditional approaches that require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable success. Additional experiments highlight ControlVLA's extensibility to long-horizon tasks and robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://controlvla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ember-lab-berkeley.github.io/LeVERB-Website/</p></details> |

However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in procedurally out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLMs and VLAs - including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA, Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST - on diverse procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexity; (2) VLAs generally outperforms other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering. We release our benchmark, evaluation framework, and findings to enable the assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in their application to out-of-distribution digital tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 26 figures |

Yet existing approaches are constrained by their dependence on hand-crafted skills, extensive parameter tuning, or computationally intensive models unsuitable for onboard use. We introduce GRaD-Nav++, a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that runs fully onboard and follows natural-language commands in real time. Our policy is trained in a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) simulator via Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DiffRL), enabling efficient learning of low-level control from visual and linguistic inputs. At its core is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) action head, which adaptively routes computation to improve generalization while mitigating forgetting. In multi-task generalization experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings. These results establish a new benchmark for fully onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) flight and demonstrate that compact, efficient models can enable reliable, language-guided navigation without relying on external infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link:https://autovla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CEED-VLA: Consistency Vision-Language-Action Model with Early-Exit Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13725v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding and generalization capabilities. Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.

| **[ROSA: Harnessing Robot States for Vision-Language and Action Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13679v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Surgical AI: Surgeon Style Fingerprinting and Privacy Risk Quantification via Discrete Diffusion in a Vision-Language-Action Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08185v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles shaped by training, experience, and motor behavior-yet most surgical AI systems overlook this personalization signal. We propose a novel agentic modeling approach for surgeon-specific behavior prediction in robotic surgery, combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Gesture prediction is framed as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including surgical video, intent language, and personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill. These embeddings are encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is https://irpn-eai.github.io/RationalVLA.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFE: Multitask Failure Detection for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09937v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

| **[From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09930v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.

| **[HiBerNAC: Hierarchical Brain-emulated Robotic Neural Agent Collective for Disentangling Complex Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08296v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

| **[Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23450v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedure (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1% and OpenVLA by 7.4% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

| **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $π_0$ using Text Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue, existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency 93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Reasoning for Perception, Explanation, and Autonomous Action in Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08462v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings. Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications. Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted deployment in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07961v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

However, its sequential autoregressive token generation introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT policies closer to practical real-time deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, their growing model size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in https://github.com/ustcwhy/BitVLA.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world, increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method, real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and "inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast, performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the presence of significant latency.

However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. Here we introduce Mask-guided feature pooling, a lightweight enhancement to existing LDRG methods. Our approach employs a two-stage training strategy: first, a vision-language model generates feature maps from CLIP-fused embeddings, which are upsampled and weighted by text embeddings to produce segmentation masks. Next, the decoder generates separate feature maps for grasp prediction, pooling only token features within these masked regions to efficiently predict grasp poses. This targeted pooling approach reduces computational complexity, accelerating both training and inference. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 12% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. By extending 2D grasp predictions to 3D via depth mapping and inverse kinematics, our modular method achieves performance comparable to recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, with improved generalization across different task suites. Real-world experiments on a 7 DoF Franka robotic arm demonstrate a 57% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 7%.

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced multi-task learning and instruction following, they typically assume static task intent, failing to respond when new instructions arrive during ongoing execution. This limitation hinders natural and robust interaction in dynamic settings, such as retail or household environments, where real-time intent changes are common. We propose SwitchVLA, a unified, execution-aware framework that enables smooth and reactive task switching without external planners or additional switch-specific data. We model task switching as a behavior modulation problem conditioned on execution state and instruction context. Expert demonstrations are segmented into temporally grounded contact phases, allowing the policy to infer task progress and adjust its behavior accordingly. A multi-behavior conditional policy is then trained to generate flexible action chunks under varying behavior modes through conditioned trajectory modeling. Experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that SwitchVLA enables robust instruction adherence, fluid task switching, and strong generalization-outperforming prior VLA baselines in both task success rate and interaction naturalness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://switchvla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Robotic Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03350v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast-in-Slow: A Dual-System Foundation Model Unifying Fast Manipulation within Slow Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01953v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized policy and execution efficiency constitute the two critical challenges in robotic manipulation. While recent foundation policies benefit from the common-sense reasoning capabilities of internet-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), they often suffer from low execution frequency. To mitigate this dilemma, dual-system approaches, inspired by Kahneman's theory, have been proposed to leverage a VLM-based System 2 model handling high-level reasoning and a separate System 1 action model ensuring real-time control. However, existing designs maintain both systems as separate models, limiting System 1 from fully leveraging the rich pretrained knowledge from the VLM-based System 2. In this work, we propose Fast-in-Slow (FiS), a unified dual-system vision-language-action (VLA) model that embeds the System 1 execution module within the VLM-based System 2 by partially sharing parameters. This innovative paradigm not only enables high-frequency execution in System 1 but also facilitates coordination between the reasoning and execution components within a single foundation model of System 2. Given their fundamentally distinct roles within FiS-VLA, we design the two systems to incorporate heterogeneous modality inputs alongside asynchronous operating frequencies, enabling both fast and precise manipulation. To enable coordination between the two systems, a dual-aware co-training strategy is proposed that equips System 1 with action generation capabilities while preserving System 2's contextual reasoning representation. For evaluation, FiS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 8% in simulation and 11% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, while achieving a 117.7 Hz control frequency with action chunk set to eight.

Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code, pretrained models, and training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages.

| **[MLA-Trust: Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal LLM Agents in GUI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01616v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAgent-V: A Reward-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01300v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |

This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OG-VLA: 3D-Aware Vision Language Action Model via Orthographic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01196v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs) with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[SafeVLA: Towards Safety Alignment of Vision-Language-Action Model via Constrained Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03480v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) show potential as generalist robot policies. However, these models pose extreme safety challenges during real-world deployment, including the risk of harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety constraints be explicitly integrated into VLAs? We address this by exploring an integrated safety approach (ISA), systematically modeling safety requirements, then actively eliciting diverse unsafe behaviors, effectively constraining VLA policies via safe reinforcement learning, and rigorously assuring their safety through targeted evaluations. Leveraging the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) paradigm, ISA optimizes VLAs from a min-max perspective against elicited safety risks. Thus, policies aligned through this comprehensive approach achieve the following key features: (I) effective safety-performance trade-offs, this exploration yields an 83.58% safety improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art method, while also maintaining task performance (+3.85%). (II) strong safety assurance, with the ability to mitigate long-tail risks and handle extreme failure scenarios. (III) robust generalization of learned safety behaviors to various out-of-distribution perturbations. Our data, models and newly proposed benchmark environment are available at https://pku-safevla.github.io.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[LoHoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00411v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions. Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e., decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e., generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA) models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning for Efficient Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15304v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network (DNN)-based policy models, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models, excel at automating complex decision-making from multi-modal inputs. However, scaling these models greatly increases computational overhead, complicating deployment in resource-constrained settings like robot manipulation and autonomous driving. To address this, we propose Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning (SQIL), which combines quantization-aware training with a selective loss-weighting strategy for mission-critical states. By identifying these states via saliency scores and emphasizing them in the training loss, SQIL preserves decision fidelity under low-bit precision. We validate SQIL's generalization capability across extensive simulation benchmarks with environment variations, real-world tasks, and cross-domain tasks (self-driving, physics simulation), consistently recovering full-precision performance. Notably, a 4-bit weight-quantized VLA model for robotic manipulation achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings on an edge GPU with minimal accuracy loss. These results underline SQIL's potential for efficiently deploying large IL-based policy models on resource-limited devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.01034</p></details> |

We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</p></details> |  |

Because the research into the use of robots for creativity support with older adults remains underexplored, we carried out an exploratory case study. We took a participatory approach and collaborated with professional art educators to design a course Drawing with Robots for adults aged 65 and over. The course featured human-human and human-robot drawing activities with various types of robots. We observed collaborative drawing interactions, interviewed participants on their experiences, and analyzed collected data. Findings show that participants preferred acting as curators, evaluating creative suggestions from the robot in a teacher or coach role. When we enhanced a robot with a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), participants appreciated its spoken dialogue capabilities. They reported however, that the robot's feedback sometimes lacked an understanding of the context, and sensitivity to their artistic goals and preferences. Our findings highlight the potential of LLM-enhanced robots to support creativity and offer future directions for advancing human-robot co-creativity with older adults.</p></details> |  |

This introduces new challenges in scheduling and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety. The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation. The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety during the construction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Building upon this foundation, a communication architecture is proposed to enable monitoring, control, and teleoperation for a Power to X platform. To reduce the demand for human labor, a robotic system is integrated to autonomously perform inspection and maintenance tasks. The implementation utilizes a quadruped robot. Remote monitoring, control, and teleoperation of the robot are analyzed within the context of a 5G standalone network. As part of the evaluation, aspects such as availability and latency are recorded, compared, and critically assessed.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the spiked covariance model, we propose the multi-rank Subspace-CUSUM procedure, which extends the classical CUSUM framework by tracking the top principal components to approximate a likelihood ratio. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method by characterizing the expected detection statistics under both pre- and post-change regimes and offer principled guidance for selecting the drift and threshold parameters to control the false alarm rate. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulations and a real-world application to robotic swarm behavior data.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and Accepted for Presentation at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup, including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | 4 pages, 8 fugures |

This work explores what happens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we present a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye model that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present a reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We conducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the robot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and interrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of instructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure, participants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected erroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based mirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes. These results suggest a beneficial and intuitive utilization of the introduced method in cooperative human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)</p></details> |

The open-ended learning framework identifies the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks, and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the various challenges of open-ended learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RLDM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate the flexibility and robustness of cart-pushing methods in experiments.

Most prior work has relied on scripted or Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time, interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary (memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions: (1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Manipulation of a Rotating Chain with Bottom End Fixed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18355v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a Vision-to-4D-to-Action (V-4D-A) framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</p></details> |  |

Traditional automation methods for oocyte transfer rely heavily on visual perception, often requiring human supervision due to biological variability and environmental disturbances. Haptic-ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments.

| **[Integrating LLMs and Digital Twins for Adaptive Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18178v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems are emerging as a promising solution to the growing demand for productivity, safety, and adaptability across industrial sectors. However, effectively coordinating multiple robots in dynamic and uncertain environments, such as construction sites, remains a challenge, particularly due to unpredictable factors like material delays, unexpected site conditions, and weather-induced disruptions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the synergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally defined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot heterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A mechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which unstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and optimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop flexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been developed to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and their digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that the system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case study demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization algorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing models achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction. The results confirm the practicality, adaptability, and cross-domain applicability of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Plan Refinement for Improving Efficiency of Robotic Layup of Composite Sheets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18160v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition. Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite manufacturing automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18123v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robo-arena.github.io/</p></details> |

Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted and published at IEEE T-RO</p></details> |

However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://robotwin-platform.github.io/</p></details> |

However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoder model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments.

However, their proprioceptive capabilities remain limited, particularly in narrow lumens, where lack of environmental awareness can lead to unintended tissue contact and surgical risks. To address this challenge, this work proposes a flexible annular sensor structure integrated around the vertebral disks of continuum robots. The proposed design enables real-time environmental mapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced control strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle detection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC) technology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with compact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow compatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising solution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical robotics.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the effects of these technologies over time remain unexplored. In this study, we use a factorial design to assess the impact of embodiment and time spent engaging in therapeutic exercises on participant disclosures. We assessed transcripts gathered from a two-week study in which 26 university student participants completed daily interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises in their residences using either an LLM-powered SAR or a disembodied chatbot. We evaluated the levels of active engagement and high intimacy of their disclosures (opinions, judgments, and emotions) during each session and over time. Our findings show significant interactions between time and embodiment for both outcome measures: participant engagement and intimacy increased over time in the physical robot condition, while both measures decreased in the chatbot condition.</p></details> |  |

The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy.

However, enabling a robot to actively maneuver its neck can significantly expand the scope of imitation learning to encompass a wider variety of tasks and expressive actions such as neck gestures. To facilitate imitation learning in robots capable of neck movement while simultaneously performing object manipulation, we propose a teaching system that systematically collects datasets incorporating neck movements while minimizing discomfort caused by dynamic viewpoints during teleoperation. In addition, we present a novel network model for learning manipulation tasks including active neck motion. Experimental results showed that our model can achieve a high success rate of around 90\%, regardless of the distraction from the viewpoint variations by active neck motion. Moreover, the proposed model proved particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as when objects were situated at the periphery or beyond the standard field of view, where traditional models struggled. The proposed approach contributes to the efficiency of dataset collection and extends the applicability of imitation learning to more complex and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor).

| **[General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17462v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the problem of planning in uncertain environments with a heterogeneous robot team of fast scout vehicles for information gathering and more risk-averse carrier robots from which the scouts vehicles are deployed. To overcome the computational challenges, we represent the environment and operational scenario using a topological graph, where the parameters of the edge weight distributions vary with the state of the robot team on the graph, and we formulate a computationally efficient mixed-integer program which removes the dependence on the number of robots from its decision space. Our formulation results in the capability to generate optimal multi-robot, long-horizon plans in seconds that could otherwise be computationally intractable. Ultimately our approach enables real-time re-planning, since the computation time is significantly faster than the time to execute one step. We evaluate our algorithm in a scenario where the robot team must traverse an environment while minimizing detection by observers in positions that are uncertain to the robot team. We demonstrate that our method is computationally tractable, can improve performance in the presence of imperfect information, and can be adjusted for different risk profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2025 IEEE.

At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required for real-time robotic applications.

However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experimental Setup and Software Pipeline to Evaluate Optimization based Autonomous Multi-Robot Search Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16710v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot systems domain given its applications in search \& rescue and hazard localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IDETC 2025 conference proceedings</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Performance-guided Physiological signal-based Trust Prediction (PPTP), a novel framework designed to improve trust assessment. We designed a human-robot construction scenario with three difficulty levels to induce different trust states. Our approach integrates synchronized multimodal physiological signals (ECG, GSR, and EMG) with collaboration performance evaluation to predict human trust levels. Individual physiological signals are processed using collaboration performance information as guiding cues, leveraging the standardized nature of collaboration performance to compensate for individual variations in physiological responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our cross-modality fusion method in significantly improving trust classification performance. Our model achieves over 81% accuracy in three-level trust classification, outperforming the best baseline method by 6.7%, and notably reaches 74.3% accuracy in high-resolution seven-level classification, which is a first in trust prediction research. Ablation experiments further validate the superiority of physiological signal processing guided by collaboration performance assessment.</p></details> |  |

Expressiveness and Clarity in Robot Display Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16643v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonverbal visual symbols and displays play an important role in communication when humans and robots work collaboratively. However, few studies have investigated how different types of non-verbal cues affect objective task performance, especially in a dynamic environment that requires real time decision-making. In this work, we designed a collaborative navigation task where the user and the robot only had partial information about the map on each end and thus the users were forced to communicate with a robot to complete the task. We conducted our study in a public space and recruited 37 participants who randomly passed by our setup. Each participant collaborated with a robot utilizing either animated anthropomorphic eyes and animated icons, or static anthropomorphic eyes and static icons. We found that participants that interacted with a robot with animated displays reported the greatest level of trust and satisfaction; that participants interpreted static icons the best; and that participants with a robot with static eyes had the highest completion success. These results suggest that while animation can foster trust with robots, human-robot communication can be optimized by the addition of familiar static icons that may be easier for users to interpret. We published our code, designed symbols, and collected results online at: https://github.com/mattufts/huamn_Cozmo_interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Optimization-Augmented Control Framework for Single and Coordinated Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16555v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation demands precise control over both contact forces and motion trajectories. While force control is essential for achieving compliant interaction and high-frequency adaptation, it is limited to operations in close proximity to the manipulated object and often fails to maintain stable orientation during extended motion sequences. Conversely, optimization-based motion planning excels in generating collision-free trajectories over the robot's configuration space but struggles with dynamic interactions where contact forces play a crucial role. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal control framework that combines force control and optimization-augmented motion planning to tackle complex robotic manipulation tasks in a sequential manner, enabling seamless switching between control modes based on task requirements. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into subtasks, each dynamically assigned to one of three control modes: Pure optimization for global motion planning, pure force control for precise interaction, or hybrid control for tasks requiring simultaneous trajectory tracking and force regulation. This framework is particularly advantageous for bimanual and multi-arm manipulation, where synchronous motion and coordination among arms are essential while considering both the manipulated object and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through a range of long-horizon manipulation tasks, including single-arm, bimanual, and multi-arm applications, highlighting its ability to handle both free-space motion and contact-rich manipulation with robustness and precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for oral presentation at IROS 2025.

The system decomposes natural language instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in the face of uncertainty and failure.</p></details> |  |

Language Alignment in AI Emotional Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16473v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H) therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations), and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects' disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.</p></details> |  |

Quasi-Direct-Drive (QDD) actuators with single-stage planetary gearboxes offer low inertia, high efficiency, and transparency. Among planetary gearbox architectures, Internal (ISSPG) and External Single-Stage Planetary Gearbox (ESSPG) are the two predominant designs. While ISSPG is often preferred for its compactness and high torque density at certain gear ratios, no objective comparison between the two architectures exists. Additionally, existing designs rely on heuristics rather than systematic optimization. This paper presents a design framework for optimally selecting actuator parameters based on given performance requirements and motor specifications. Using this framework, we generate and analyze various optimized gearbox designs for both architectures. Our results demonstrate that for the T-motor U12, ISSPG is the superior choice within the lower gear ratio range of 5:1 to 7:1, offering a lighter design. However, for gear ratios exceeding 7:1, ISSPG becomes infeasible, making ESSPG the better option in the 7:1 to 11:1 range. To validate our approach, we designed and optimized two actuators for manufacturing: an ISSPG with a 6.0:1 gear ratio and an ESSPG with a 7.2:1 gear ratio. Their respective masses closely align with our optimization model predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at Advances in Robotics 2025</p></details> |

However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulation manipulation.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule, which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally, FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference speed.</p></details> |  |

However, existing sound source localization methods typically rely on a microphone array with at least two spatially preconfigured microphones. This requirement hinders the applicability of microphone-based robot audition systems and technologies. To alleviate these challenges, we propose an online sound source localization method that uses a single microphone mounted on a mobile robot in reverberant environments. Specifically, we develop a lightweight neural network model with only 43k parameters to perform real-time distance estimation by extracting temporal information from reverberant signals. The estimated distances are then processed using an extended Kalman filter to achieve online sound source localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve online sound source localization using a single microphone on a moving robot, a gap that we aim to fill in this work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach.

It allows the robot to exert minimal force on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements, allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ inspection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, published in T-MECH</p></details> |

However, variations in structural configurations, measured signals, and material properties create domain gaps that limit the transferability of learned force sensation across different tactile sensors. Here, we introduce GenForce, a general framework for achieving transferable force sensation across both homogeneous and heterogeneous tactile sensors in robotic systems. By unifying tactile signals into marker-based binary tactile images, GenForce enables the transfer of existing force labels to arbitrary target sensors using a marker-to-marker translation technique with a few paired data. This process equips uncalibrated tactile sensors with force prediction capabilities through spatiotemporal force prediction models trained on the transferred data. Extensive experimental results validate GenForce's generalizability, accuracy, and robustness across sensors with diverse marker patterns, structural designs, material properties, and sensing principles. The framework significantly reduces the need for costly and labor-intensive labeled data collection, enabling the rapid deployment of multiple tactile sensors on robotic hands requiring force sensing capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Agricultural robotics has emerged as a promising response to these pressures, enabling the automation of precise and suitable field operations. In particular, robots equipped with implements for tasks such as weeding or sowing must interact delicately and accurately with the crops and soil. Unlike robots in other domains, these agricultural platforms typically use rigidly mounted implements, where the implement's position is more critical than the robot's center in determining task success. Yet, most control strategies in the literature focus on the vehicle body, often neglecting the acctual working point of the system. This is particularly important when considering new agriculture practices where crops row are not necessary straights. This paper presents a predictive control strategy targeting the implement's reference point. The method improves tracking performance by anticipating the motion of the implement, which, due to its offset from the vehicle's center of rotation, is prone to overshooting during turns if not properly accounted for.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |

While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.</p></details> |  |

To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work. In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps, including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with 4\%$\sim$10\% lower error.

However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</p></details> |  |

We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively.

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

| **[HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15947v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) are emerging as a promising paradigm to support various low-altitude services through integrated air-ground infrastructure. To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14769v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Diffusion for Cross-Embodiment Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14608v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end learning approaches offer great potential for robotic manipulation, but their impact is constrained by data scarcity and heterogeneity across different embodiments. In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 13% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Most common steering approaches, like goal-conditioning, require training the robot policy with a distribution of test-time objectives in mind. To overcome this limitation, we present DynaGuide, a steering method for diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the diffusion denoising process. DynaGuide separates the dynamics model from the base policy, which gives it multiple advantages, including the ability to steer towards multiple objectives, enhance underrepresented base policy behaviors, and maintain robustness on low-quality objectives. The separate guidance signal also allows DynaGuide to work with off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion policies. We demonstrate the performance and features of DynaGuide against other steering approaches in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing an average steering success of 70% on a set of articulated CALVIN tasks and outperforming goal-conditioning by 5.4x when steered with low-quality objectives.

| **[Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13456v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13111v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

| **[Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12678v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[DIME:Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02316v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text, 20 pages all included</p></details> |
| **[DemoSpeedup: Accelerating Visuomotor Policies via Entropy-Guided Demonstration Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05064v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand, robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable, high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and ease of adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Perception and Action: Spatially-Grounded Mid-Level Representations for Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06196v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11% higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more granular, actionable representations.

However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RA-L with IROS presentation option (2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11612v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with a Gaussian policy has become a mainstream implementation for realizing the Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) objective, which incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration and enhance policy robustness. While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .</p></details> |  |
| **[Mini Diffuser: Fast Multi-task Diffusion Policy Training Using Two-level Mini-batches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method that reduces, by an order of magnitude, the time and memory needed to train multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: In image generation, the target is high-dimensional. By contrast, in action generation, the dimensionality of the target is comparatively small, and only the image condition is high-dimensional. Our approach, \emph{Mini Diffuser}, exploits this asymmetry by introducing \emph{two-level minibatching}, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.</p></details> | 4pages |

However, prior work that explored this direction focused primarily on point cloud inputs generated by multiple cameras fixed in the workspace. This type of point cloud input is not compatible with the now-common setting where the primary input modality is an eye-in-hand RGB camera like a GoPro. This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in SO(3) without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Our work is the first SO(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for robotic manipulation that works using only monocular RGB inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Falcon: Fast Visuomotor Policies via Partial Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00339v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies are widely adopted in complex visuomotor tasks for their ability to capture multimodal action distributions. However, the multiple sampling steps required for action generation significantly harm real-time inference efficiency, which limits their applicability in real-time decision-making scenarios. Existing acceleration techniques either require retraining or degrade performance under low sampling steps. Here we propose Falcon, which mitigates this speed-performance trade-off and achieves further acceleration. The core insight is that visuomotor tasks exhibit sequential dependencies between actions. Falcon leverages this by reusing partially denoised actions from historical information rather than sampling from Gaussian noise at each step. By integrating current observations, Falcon reduces sampling steps while preserving performance. Importantly, Falcon is a training-free algorithm that can be applied as a plug-in to further improve decision efficiency on top of existing acceleration techniques. We validated Falcon in 48 simulated environments and 2 real-world robot experiments. demonstrating a 2-7x speedup with negligible performance degradation, offering a promising direction for efficient visuomotor policy design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Generalizable Bimanual Foundation Policy via Flow-based Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24156v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot, and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced DACER Algorithm with High Diffusion Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23426v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step. Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy. To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to DACER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior-Regularized Diffusion Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04778v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior regularization, which constrains the policy to stay close to some behavior policy, is widely used in offline reinforcement learning (RL) to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of unseen actions. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rhetorical Text-to-Image Generation via Two-layer Diffusion Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22792v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Guided Diffusional Subgoals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21750v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[GenPO: Generative Diffusion Models Meet On-Policy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18763v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09342v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2025.

Recent works show their promise for sequential decision-making and dexterous manipulation, leveraging their ability to model complex action distributions. However, challenges persist due to the data limitations and scenario-specific adaptation needs. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing an optimized approach to training diffusion policies using large, pre-built datasets that are enhanced using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our end-to-end pipeline leverages RL-based enhancement of the DexGraspNet dataset, lightweight diffusion policy training on a dexterous manipulation task for a five-fingered robotic hand, and a pose sampling algorithm for validation. The pipeline achieved a high success rate of 80% for three DexGraspNet objects. By eliminating manual data collection, our approach lowers barriers to adopting diffusion models in robotics, enhancing generalization and robustness for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects in 3D: Simulation, Benchmark and Learning Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17434v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation is inherently challenging due to complex system dynamics and stringent task constraints, particularly in deformable object scenarios characterized by high degrees of freedom and underactuation. Prior methods often simplify the problem to low-speed or 2D settings, limiting their applicability to real-world 3D tasks. In this work, we explore 3D goal-conditioned rope manipulation as a representative challenge. To mitigate data scarcity, we introduce a novel simulation framework and benchmark grounded in reduced-order dynamics, which enables compact state representation and facilitates efficient policy learning. Building on this, we propose Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP), a framework that integrates imitation pretraining with physics-informed test-time adaptation. First, we design a diffusion policy that learns inverse dynamics within the reduced-order space, enabling imitation learning to move beyond na\"ive data fitting and capture the underlying physical structure. Second, we propose a physics-informed test-time adaptation scheme that imposes kinematic boundary conditions and structured dynamics priors on the diffusion process, ensuring consistency and reliability in manipulation execution. Extensive experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating strong performance in terms of accuracy and robustness in the learned policy.</p></details> | 11 pages, |
| **[Safe Uncertainty-Aware Learning of Robotic Suturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16596v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario. Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera, and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations, showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety set in the case of unsafe predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Diffusion Models for Neural Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15157v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.</p></details> | ICRA'25 |
| **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Group and Grasp Multiple Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08452v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously grasping and delivering multiple objects can significantly enhance robotic work efficiency and has been a key research focus for decades. The primary challenge lies in determining how to push objects, group them, and execute simultaneous grasping for respective groups while considering object distribution and the hardware constraints of the robot. Traditional rule-based methods struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an imitation learning-based approach. We collect a series of expert demonstrations through teleoperation and train a diffusion policy network, enabling the robot to dynamically generate action sequences for pushing, grouping, and grasping, thereby facilitating efficient multi-object grasping and delivery. We conducted experiments to evaluate the method under different training dataset sizes, varying object quantities, and real-world object scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively and adaptively generate multi-object grouping and grasping strategies. With the support of more training data, imitation learning is expected to be an effective approach for solving the multi-object grasping problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Diffusion Policy Training: Decoupling and Recombining Guidance and Diffusion for Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03154v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations, actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior, suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model, based on three key findings: Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity for optimization. Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and enhances both sample efficiency and final performance. Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability. We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular, reusable, and composable training pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Long-Context Diffusion Policies via Past-Token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09561v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos are available at https://long-context-dp.github.io</p></details> |
| **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, limiting their applicability to tasks where historical context is crucial for disambiguating current observations. This limitation hinders performance in long-horizon sequential manipulation tasks where the correct action depends on past events not fully captured by the current state. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL), a novel approach that leverages the recurrent state dynamics inherent in State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the Mamba architecture. MTIL encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed hidden state, conditioning action predictions on this comprehensive temporal context alongside current multi-modal observations. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT dataset tasks, Robomimic, LIBERO) and real-world sequential manipulation tasks specifically designed to probe temporal dependencies, MTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy. Our findings affirm the necessity of full temporal context for robust sequential decision-making and validate MTIL as a powerful approach that transcends the inherent limitations of Markovian imitation learning</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures,Submitted to IEEE RAL</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11719v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.
