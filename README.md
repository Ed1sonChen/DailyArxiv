| **[Survey of Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15201v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence systems, which enhance agent capabilities through continuous environment interactions, have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[MinD: Learning A Dual-System World Model for Real-Time Planning and Implicit Risk Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Generation Models (VGMs) have become powerful backbones for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging large-scale pretraining for robust dynamics modeling. However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-Generalist: Self-Improving Vision-Language-Action Models for Crafting 3D Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06484v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |
| **[CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions, but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Actions in Camera Space: Observation-Centric Vision-Language-Action Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13103v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA) framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General Physical Intelligence for Resilient Agile Manufacturing Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11960v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agile and human-centric manufacturing stipulates resilient robotic solutions capable of contextual reasoning and safe interaction in unstructured environments. Foundation models particularly the Vision Language Action (VLA) models have emerged to fuse multimodal perception, reasoning and physically grounded action across varied embodiments into unified representation, termed as General Physical Intelligence (GPI). While GPI has already been described in the literature but its practical application and evolving role in contemporary agile manufacturing processes have yet to be duly explored. To bridge this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advancements in VLA models within GPI context, performs comprehensive comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluates their readiness for industrial deployment through structured ablation study. Our analysis has organized state-of-the-art into five thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, we articulate open research challenges and propose directions to better integrate GPI into next-generation industrial ecosystems in line with Industry 5.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> |
| **[IRL-VLA: Training an Vision-Language-Action Policy via Reward World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06571v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1) Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset, leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.</p></details> | 9 pagres, 2 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08189v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

| **[Towards Embodied Agentic AI: Review and Classification of LLM- and VLM-Driven Robot Autonomy and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05294v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrectNav: Self-Correction Flywheel Empowers Vision-Language-Action Navigation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10416v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set, uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Model Empowered Embodied AI: A Survey on Decision-Making and Embodied Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10399v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReconVLA: Reconstructive Vision-Language-Action Model as Effective Robot Perceiver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10333v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel, it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert, which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2 simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is visible at https://linsun449.github.io/GeoVLA/</p></details> |

Our platform combines automated scene construction that encompasses layout generation, semantic asset placement, visual material configuration, and physics simulation, with a dual-mode teleoperation system supporting both wheeled bases and humanoid locomotion policies for data collection. The resulting AgentWorld Dataset captures diverse tasks ranging from primitive actions (pick-and-place, push-pull, etc.) to multistage activities (serve drinks, heat up food, etc.) across living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Through extensive benchmarking of imitation learning methods including behavior cloning, action chunking transformers, diffusion policies, and vision-language-action models, we demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for sim-to-real transfer. The integrated system provides a comprehensive solution for scalable robotic skill acquisition in complex home environments, bridging the gap between simulation-based training and real-world deployment.

| **[Spatial Traces: Enhancing VLA Models with Spatial-Temporal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09032v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

| **[OmniVTLA: Vision-Tactile-Language-Action Model with Semantic-Aligned Tactile Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08706v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories. With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides, OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[GraphCoT-VLA: A 3D Spatial-Aware Reasoning Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation with Ambiguous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07650v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/.

| **[Information-Theoretic Graph Fusion with Vision-Language-Action Model for Policy Reasoning and Dual Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05342v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90 percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across diverse spatial and semantic variations.</p></details> | Journal under review |

In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

| **[Perceiving and Acting in First-Person: A Dataset and Benchmark for Egocentric Human-Object-Human Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04681v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models fundamentally transform this approach by employing a single neural network that can simultaneously process visual observations, understand human instructions, and directly output robot actions -- all within a unified framework. However, these systems are highly dependent on high-quality training datasets that can capture the complex relationships between visual observations, language instructions, and robotic actions. This tutorial reviews three representative systems: the PyBullet simulation framework for flexible customized data generation, the LIBERO benchmark suite for standardized task definition and evaluation, and the RT-X dataset collection for large-scale multi-robot data acquisition. We demonstrated dataset generation approaches in PyBullet simulation and customized data collection within LIBERO, and provide an overview of the characteristics and roles of the RT-X dataset for large-scale multi-robot data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a tutorial note for educational purposes</p></details> |

However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

However, their success rates are often not on par with expert policies, and they require fine-tuning when the setup changes. In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that bridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with behavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into compact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during RL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in simulation. While this is a key requirement for applying RL, it also yields new insights beyond existing studies on VLA performance in real-world settings. Our experimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables the RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both dense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than the RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  |

This progress inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT, an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods, achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[RICL: Adding In-Context Adaptability to Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02062v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments. However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning. Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20 demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning interface for new manipulation tasks.

| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $π_0$ using Text Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Despite their significant capabilities, VLA models introduce new attack surfaces. This paper systematically evaluates their robustness. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV camera ready; Github: https://github.com/William-wAng618/roboticAttack Homepage: https://vlaattacker.github.io/</p></details> |

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks. Furthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including recognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://chain-of-affordance.github.io</p></details> |

Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration.

To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment.

However, VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by 44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without compromising the success rate.

However, state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks. Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision.

However, existing vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm, Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world settings.

However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence Calibration in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17383v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants, finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

GR-3 is a large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model. It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects, environments, and instructions involving abstract concepts.

These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline method, $\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging tasks.

Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes. Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

| **[Neural Robot Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15755v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however, existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state. In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Universal Dancing by Luminous Robots under Sequential Schedulers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15484v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations (e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries, contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns, only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed choreography.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Based Shared-Control Teleoperation Scheme for Controlling the Robotic Arm of a Four-Legged Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14994v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.</p></details> |  |

To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[Safe and Transparent Robots for Human-in-the-Loop Meat Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14763v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots. For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's actions which we validate through a user study.</p></details> |  |

| **[Robust simultaneous UWB-anchor calibration and robot localization for emergency situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22272v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework. The supplementary video and codes can be accessed via https://github.com/LiuxhRobotAI/Simultaneous_calibration_localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE SMC 2025.

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-optimal Asynchronous Minimal Vertex Covering by Myopic Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14247v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility, it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially. Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous ($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the \emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term "social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, presented at TRUST workshop, organised in conjunction with the IEEE RO-MAN 2025 conference, held in Eindhoven, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

These blast holes need to be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face. We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

| **[Assessing Pedestrian Behavior Around Autonomous Cleaning Robots in Public Spaces: Findings from a Field Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13699v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions, and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead, both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Three-Level Whole-Body Disturbance Rejection Control Framework for Dynamic Motions in Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13531v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Integrating emotional intelligence, memory architecture, and gestures to achieve empathetic humanoid robot interaction in an educational setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19803v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the integration of individual human traits into an empathetically adaptive educational robot tutor system designed to improve student engagement and learning outcomes with corresponding Engagement Vector measurement. While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes to the robot's intelligent core mimicing the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture control to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student's emotional state. It can also recall the student's past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study investigates the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a surveyor's pole for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student.</p></details> |  |

The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.</p></details> | 4 pages, 5 figures |

In this research, HRL is evaluated and contrasted with traditional RL in complex robotic navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including its ability to create sub-goals and the termination functions. We constructed a number of experiments to test: 1) the differences between RL proximal policy optimization (PPO) and HRL, 2) different ways of creating sub-goals in HRL, 3) manual vs automatic sub-goal creation in HRL, and 4) the effects of the frequency of termination on performance in HRL. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL over RL and how it achieves these advantages.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

However, they are still missing a fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain, and briefly discuss evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop "Human - Foundation Models Interaction: A Focus On Multimodal Information" (FoMo-HRI) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025 (Camera-ready version)</p></details> |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[RoboRetriever: Single-Camera Robot Object Retrieval via Active and Interactive Perception with Dynamic Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12916v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans effortlessly retrieve objects in cluttered, partially observable environments by combining visual reasoning, active viewpoint adjustment, and physical interaction-with only a single pair of eyes. In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibration-Based Energy Metric for Restoring Needle Alignment in Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06921v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |

In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Although safe reactive approaches have been proposed to ensure robot safety in complex environments, many base their theory off the assumption that the robot has prior knowledge on obstacle locations and geometries. In this paper, we present a real-time, vision-based framework that constructs continuous, first-order differentiable Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) of unknown environments entirely online, without any pre-training, and is fully compatible with established SDF-based reactive controllers. To achieve robust performance under practical sensing conditions, our approach explicitly accounts for noise in affordable RGB-D cameras, refining the neural SDF representation online for smoother geometry and stable gradient estimates. We validate the proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments using a Fetch robot.</p></details> |  |

Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[The Foundational Pose as a Selection Mechanism for the Design of Tool-Wielding Multi-Finger Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14158v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To wield an object means to hold and move it in a way that exploits its functions. When humans wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hand through a hypothesis: If a hand can kinematically reach a foundational pose (FP) with a tool, then it can wield the tool from that FP. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying parallel mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based multi-objective design optimization framework that uses three FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them. The results show that 10,785 out of the 100,480 hand designs we sampled reached the FPs; more than 99\% of the 10,785 hands that reached the FPs successfully wielded tools, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem -- such as clustering and the Pareto front -- that could be hard to unveil with methods that return a single ``optimal" design. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and collected two datasets to study the impact of data representation and model architecture on the recognition accuracy. Our results show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy, while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to new robot poses, where spectrogram-based models performed better. Implemented on a Franka Emika Research robot, two of our methods, STFT2DCNN and STT3DCNN, achieved over 95% accuracy in contact detection and gesture classification. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of external-sensor-free tactile recognition and promote further research toward cost-effective, scalable solutions for HRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths. The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[A robust and compliant robotic assembly control strategy for batch precision assembly task with uncertain fit types and fit amounts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12296v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In some high-precision industrial applications, robots are deployed to perform precision assembly tasks on mass batches of manufactured pegs and holes. If the peg and hole are designed with transition fit, machining errors may lead to either a clearance or an interference fit for a specific pair of components, with uncertain fit amounts. This paper focuses on the robotic batch precision assembly task involving components with uncertain fit types and fit amounts, and proposes an efficient methodology to construct the robust and compliant assembly control strategy. Specifically, the batch precision assembly task is decomposed into multiple deterministic subtasks, and a force-vision fusion controller-driven reinforcement learning method and a multi-task reinforcement learning training method (FVFC-MTRL) are proposed to jointly learn multiple compliance control strategies for these subtasks. Subsequently, the multi-teacher policy distillation approach is designed to integrate multiple trained strategies into a unified student network, thereby establishing a robust control strategy. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method successfully constructs the robust control strategy for high-precision assembly task with different fit types and fit amounts. Moreover, the MTRL framework significantly improves training efficiency, and the final developed control strategy achieves superior force compliance and higher success rate compared with many existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bimanual Robot-Assisted Dressing: A Spherical Coordinate-Based Strategy for Tight-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12274v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted dressing is a popular but challenging topic in the field of robotic manipulation, offering significant potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with mobility limitations. Currently, the majority of research on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting clothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since the armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing task successfully. However, for the latter, dressing with a single robotic arm often fails due to the narrower armscye and the property of diminishing rigidity in the armscye, which eventually causes the armscye to get stuck. This paper proposes a bimanual dressing strategy suitable for dressing tight-fitting clothing. To facilitate the encoding of dressing trajectories that adapt to different human arm postures, a spherical coordinate system for dressing is established. We uses the azimuthal angle of the spherical coordinate system as a task-relevant feature for bimanual manipulation. Based on this new coordinate, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for imitation learning of bimanual dressing trajectories, generating dressing strategies that adapt to different human arm postures. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through various experiments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 41 figures |

Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.

| **[Energy Efficiency in Robotics Software: A Systematic Literature Review (2020-2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12170v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a systematic literature review of software-level approaches to energy efficiency in robotics published from 2020 through 2024, updating and extending pre-2020 evidence. An automated-but-audited pipeline combined Google Scholar seeding, backward/forward snowballing, and large-language-model (LLM) assistance for screening and data extraction, with ~10% human audits at each automated step and consensus-with-tie-breaks for full-text decisions. The final corpus comprises 79 peer-reviewed studies analyzed across application domain, metrics, evaluation type, energy models, major energy consumers, software technique families, and energy-quality trade-offs. Industrial settings dominate (31.6%) followed by exploration (25.3%). Motors/actuators are identified as the primary consumer in 68.4% of studies, with computing/controllers a distant second (13.9%). Simulation-only evaluations remain most common (51.9%), though hybrid evaluations are frequent (25.3%). Representational (physics-grounded) energy models predominate (87.3%). Motion and trajectory optimization is the leading technique family (69.6%), often paired with learning/prediction (40.5%) and computation allocation/scheduling (26.6%); power management/idle control (11.4%) and communication/data efficiency (3.8%) are comparatively underexplored. Reporting is heterogeneous: composite objectives that include energy are most common, while task-normalized and performance-per-energy metrics appear less often, limiting cross-paper comparability. The review offers a minimal reporting checklist (e.g., total energy and average power plus a task-normalized metric and clear baselines) and highlights opportunities in cross-layer designs and in quantifying non-performance trade-offs (accuracy, stability). A replication package with code, prompts, and frozen datasets accompanies the review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotic Systems and Applications</p></details> |

To reduce network complexity and inference latency, the SNN architecture is simplified to include only an input and an output layer, which shows strong potential for resource-constrained environments. Building on the advantages of SNNs-high inference speed, low energy consumption, and spike-based biological plausibility, a temporal progress-partitioned curriculum strategy is integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Meanwhile, an energy consumption modeling framework is introduced to quantitatively compare the theoretical energy consumption between SNNs and conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). A dynamic two-stage reward adjustment mechanism and optimized observation space further improve learning efficiency and policy accuracy. Experiments on the Isaac Gym simulation platform demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under realistic physical constraints. Comparative evaluations with conventional PPO and ANN baselines validate the scalability and energy efficiency of the proposed approach in dynamic robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This evolution requires robots to not only interpret high-level instructions and plan tasks but also perceive and adapt within dynamic environments. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a promising solution by combining visual understanding and language reasoning. However, existing VLM-based methods struggle with interactive exploration, accurate perception, and real-time plan adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ExploreVLM, a novel closed-loop task planning framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The framework is built around a step-wise feedback mechanism that enables real-time plan adjustment and supports interactive exploration. At its core is a dual-stage task planner with self-reflection, enhanced by an object-centric spatial relation graph that provides structured, language-grounded scene representations to guide perception and planning. An execution validator supports the closed loop by verifying each action and triggering re-planning. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ExploreVLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in exploration-centric tasks. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the reflective planner and structured perception in achieving robust and efficient task execution.</p></details> |  |

However, such robots have not yet achieved the same level as seen in natural systems. Recently, sampling-based predictive controllers have demonstrated particularly promising results. This paper investigates a sampling-based model predictive strategy combining model predictive path integral (MPPI) with cross-entropy (CE) and covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) methods to generate real-time whole-body motions for legged robots across multiple scenarios. The results show that combining the benefits of MPPI, CE and CMA, namely using model predictive optimized path integral (MPOPI), demonstrates greater sample efficiency, enabling robots to attain superior locomotion results using fewer samples when compared to typical MPPI algorithms. Extensive simulation experiments in multiple scenarios on a quadruped robot show that MPOPI can be used as an anytime control strategy, increasing locomotion capabilities at each iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 13 figures, Humanoid conference</p></details> |

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossing the Human-Robot Embodiment Gap with Sim-to-Real RL using One Human Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12609v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 reference, 3 figures, icassp 2026</p></details> |

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Referring Expression Instance Retrieval and A Strong End-to-End Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18246v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.</p></details> | ACMMM2025 |
| **[Synthesizing Near-Boundary OOD Samples for Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10225v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available at https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-speech-text associations: (i) gesture based retrieval, (ii) gesture word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal video-gesture-speech-text representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs). Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space.

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

| **[Pathology-Informed Latent Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection in Lymph Node Metastasis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15236v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis. While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

Existing benchmarks often fall short in capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions, leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth. Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction following capabilities through an iterative "memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance, attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth, instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13560v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes. However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate an embedding model which outputs can use a natural language instruction to control the representation of a visual embedding. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves best-for-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of visual embeddings, outputting high-quality visual representations with natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/ABC/</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |

GLOV prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to their fitness for the downstream vision task. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we explicitly guide the LLM's generation at each optimization step by adding an offset vector -- calculated from the embedding differences between previous positive and negative solutions -- to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation. This offset vector biases the LLM generation toward the type of language the downstream VLM prefers, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on two tasks: object recognition and the critical task of enhancing VLM safety. Our GLOV shows performance improvement by up to 15.0% and 57.5% for dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LlaVA) models for object recognition and reduces the attack success rate (ASR) on state-of-the-art VLMs by up to $60.7\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

Despite extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh deformations.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing Animal ReID datasets rely exclusively on visual data, overlooking environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal models capable of jointly processing visual and textual data presents new opportunities for Animal ReID, but existing datasets fail to leverage these models' text-processing capabilities, limiting their full potential. Additionally, to facilitate the use of metadata in existing ReID methods, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module that can be incorporated into existing vision-language model (VLM)-based Animal ReID methods, allowing ReID models to leverage both environmental metadata and visual information to improve ReID performance. Experiments on MetaWild show that combining baseline ReID models with MFA to incorporate metadata consistently improves performance compared to using visual information alone, validating the effectiveness of incorporating metadata in re-identification. We hope that our proposed dataset can inspire further exploration of multimodal approaches for Animal ReID.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd ICCV 2025 Workshop on the Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (13 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces MetAdv, a novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines, end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments, with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla. A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025 Demo/Videos track</p></details> |
| **[Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02028v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Rationale Explainable Object Recognition via Contrastive Conditional Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14280v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally, prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI) framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training, our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object recognition. The code will be made available online.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |

With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to 5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more generalizable Segment Anything models.

This absence limits their usefulness for developing accurate report generation AI. To address this gap, we present AbdomenAtlas 3.0, the first public, high-quality abdominal CT dataset with detailed, expert-reviewed radiology reports. All reports are paired with per-voxel masks and they describe liver, kidney and pancreatic tumors. AbdomenAtlas 3.0 has 9,262 triplets of CT, mask and report--3,955 with tumors. These CT scans come from 17 public datasets. Besides creating the reports for these datasets, we expanded their number of tumor masks by 4.2x, identifying 3,011 new tumor cases. Notably, the reports in AbdomenAtlas 3.0 are more standardized, and generated faster than traditional human-made reports. They provide details like tumor size, location, attenuation and surgical resectability. These reports were created by 12 board-certified radiologists using our proposed RadGPT, a novel framework that converted radiologist-revised tumor segmentation masks into structured and narrative reports. Besides being a dataset creation tool, RadGPT can also become a fully-automatic, segmentation-assisted report generation method. We benchmarked this method and 5 state-of-the-art report generation vision-language models. Our results show that segmentation strongly improves tumor detection in AI-made reports.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances.

However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/yejipark-m/FOCUS</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |

When these videos or materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\% MRR.

In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Fi...</summary><p>In Figure 2, the correlation coefficient and the scatter plot do not match.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[DISCO: Language-Guided Manipulation with Diffusion Policies and Constrained Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09767v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, making them promising for robotic manipulation guided by natural language instructions. However, generalizing language-conditioned diffusion policies to open-vocabulary instructions in everyday scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity and cost of robot demonstration datasets. To address this, we propose DISCO, a framework that leverages off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge natural language understanding with high-performance diffusion policies. DISCO translates linguistic task descriptions into actionable 3D keyframes using VLMs, which then guide the diffusion process through constrained inpainting. However, enforcing strict adherence to these keyframes can degrade performance when the VLM-generated keyframes are inaccurate. To mitigate this, we introduce an inpainting optimization strategy that balances keyframe adherence with learned motion priors from training data. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that DISCO outperforms conventional fine-tuned language-conditioned policies, achieving superior generalization in zero-shot, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19498v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions, but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar, RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new annotations will be released soon.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Basic Category Usage in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12530v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of psychology has long recognized a basic level of categorization that humans use when labeling visual stimuli, a term coined by Rosch in 1976. This level of categorization has been found to be used most frequently, to have higher information density, and to aid in visual language tasks with priming in humans. Here, we investigate basic-level categorization in two recently released, open-source vision-language models (VLMs). This paper demonstrates that Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct (11B) and Molmo 7B-D both prefer basic-level categorization consistent with human behavior. Moreover, the models' preferences are consistent with nuanced human behaviors like the biological versus non-biological basic level effects and the well-established expert basic level shift, further suggesting that VLMs acquire complex cognitive categorization behaviors from the human data on which they are trained. We also find our expert prompting methods demonstrate lower accuracy then our non-expert prompting methods, contradicting popular thought regarding the use of expertise prompting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras. This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling, which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens, our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or 2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks. Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs), state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is a pre-print version of a paper that has been accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality for future publication.

Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models. Our work establishes the necessity of integrating world models into autonomous agent frameworks to unlock sustained adaptability.

Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates.</p></details> |  |
| **[VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://mcp-universe.github.io</p></details> |

This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the minimum or maximum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment.

| **[MinD: Learning A Dual-System World Model for Real-Time Planning and Implicit Risk Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Generation Models (VGMs) have become powerful backbones for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging large-scale pretraining for robust dynamics modeling. However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deliberate Reasoning in Language Models as Structure-Aware Planning with an Accurate World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03136v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.</p></details> | ACL25 (main) |

However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

In contrast to existing methods that rely on computationally intensive optimization or require multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability, offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://4dnex.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://matrix-game-v2.github.io</p></details> |

Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought. For future systems, active inference may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact Contemplative AI in embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Reinforcement Learning Agents Using World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08073v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable AI (XAI) systems have been proposed to help people understand how AI systems produce outputs and behaviors. Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12087v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF, especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers, showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced data.</p></details> |  |

The learned representation is typically a neural network, making transfer of the learned environment dynamics and explainability a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach, Finite Automata Extraction (FAE), that learns a neuro-symbolic world model from gameplay video represented as programs in a novel domain-specific language (DSL): Retro Coder. Compared to prior world model approaches, FAE learns a more precise model of the environment and more general code than prior DSL-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.</p></details> |  |

Knowing the recourse, however, does not guarantee that users can implement it perfectly, either due to environmental variability or personal choices. Recourse generation should thus anticipate its sub-optimal or noisy implementation. While several approaches construct recourse that is robust to small perturbations -- e.g., arising due to its noisy implementation -- they assume that the entire recourse is implemented in a single step, thus model the noise as one-off and uniform. But these assumptions are unrealistic since recourse often entails multiple sequential steps, which makes it harder to implement and subject to increasing noise. In this work, we consider recourse under plausible noise that adheres to the local data geometry and accumulates at every step of the way. We frame this problem as a Markov Decision Process and demonstrate that such a distribution of plausible noise satisfies the Markov property. We then propose the RObust SEquential (ROSE) recourse generator for tabular data; our method produces a series of steps leading to the desired outcome even when they are implemented imperfectly. Given plausible modelling of sub-optimal human actions and greater recourse robustness to accumulated uncertainty, ROSE provides users with a high chance of success while maintaining low recourse cost. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm effectively navigates the inherent trade-off between recourse robustness and cost while ensuring its sparsity and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML-PKDD 2025 Journal Track</p></details> |

However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1) Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset, leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.</p></details> | 9 pagres, 2 figures |

Most prior approaches rely on explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping. GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras. Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |

To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

Central to this vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities, we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions. This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.</p></details> | 21 pages. 9 figures |

To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |
| **[How Safe Will I Be Given What I Saw? Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09346v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Imitation Learning Outperforms Reinforcement Learning in Surgical Action Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05011v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the MICCAI2025 workshop proceedings on COLlaborative Intelligence and Autonomy in Image-guided Surgery (COLAS)</p></details> |

These pose significant challenges to existing embodied intelligent robotics (EIR) techniques. Thus, this paper first briefly reviews the history of industrial robotics and analyzes the limitations of mainstream EIR frameworks. Then, a knowledge-driven technical framework of embodied intelligent industrial robotics (EIIR) is proposed for various industrial environments. It has five modules: a world model, a high-level task planner, a low-level skill controller, a simulator, and a physical system. The development of techniques related to each module are also thoroughly reviewed, and recent progress regarding their adaption to industrial applications are discussed. A case study is given to demonstrate the newly proposed EIIR framework's applicability to real-world assembly system. Finally, the key challenges that EIIR encounters in industrial scenarios are summarized and future research directions are suggested. The authors believe that EIIR technology is shaping the next generation of industrial robotics and EIIR-based industrial systems supply a new technological paradigm for intelligent manufacturing. It is expected that this review could serve as a valuable reference for scholars and engineers that are interested in industrial embodied intelligence. Together, scholars can use this research to drive their rapid advancement and application of EIIR techniques.

| **[Imaginative World Modeling with Scene Graphs for Embodied Agent Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06990v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic navigation requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy that predicts future scenes before taking action, can empower the agent to find target faster. Inspired by this idea, we propose SGImagineNav, a novel imaginative navigation framework that leverages symbolic world modeling to proactively build a global environmental representation. SGImagineNav maintains an evolving hierarchical scene graphs and uses large language models to predict and explore unseen parts of the environment. While existing methods solely relying on past observations, this imaginative scene graph provides richer semantic context, enabling the agent to proactively estimate target locations. Building upon this, SGImagineNav adopts an adaptive navigation strategy that exploits semantic shortcuts when promising and explores unknown areas otherwise to gather additional context. This strategy continuously expands the known environment and accumulates valuable semantic contexts, ultimately guiding the agent toward the target. SGImagineNav is evaluated in both real-world scenarios and simulation benchmarks. SGImagineNav consistently outperforms previous methods, improving success rate to 65.4 and 66.8 on HM3D and HSSD, and demonstrating cross-floor and cross-room navigation in real-world environments, underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Powered by large models such as ChatGPT and Sora, the Metaverse benefits from precise large-scale real-world modeling, automated multimodal content generation, realistic avatars, and seamless natural language understanding, which enhance user engagement and enable more personalized, intuitive interactions. However, challenges remain, including limited scalability, constrained responsiveness, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper investigates the integration of large models within the Metaverse, examining their roles in enhancing user interaction, perception, content creation, and service quality. To address existing challenges, we propose a generative AI-based framework for optimizing Metaverse rendering. This framework includes a cloud-edge-end collaborative model to allocate rendering tasks with minimal latency, a mobility-aware pre-rendering mechanism that dynamically adjusts to user movement, and a diffusion model-based adaptive rendering strategy to fine-tune visual details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing rendering efficiency and reducing rendering overheads, advancing large model deployment for a more responsive and immersive Metaverse.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Network in Aug. 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Communicative World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06659v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounding Distributional Shifts in World Modeling through Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06096v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data efficiency.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |
| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |
| **[Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing. This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals. We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[medDreamer: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Latent Imagination on Complex EHRs for Clinical Decision Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19785v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses can vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIGDreamer: Privileged Information Guided World Models for Safe Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02159v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior performance and ease of training.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Beyond Simulation: Benchmarking World Models for Planning and Causality in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01922v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.</p></details> | Accepted ICRA 2025 |
| **[$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This book provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within modular, brain-inspired architectures that integrate principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we systematically investigate the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, goal, and emotion. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms. Third, we examine multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from different disciplines, this survey identifies key research challenges and opportunities, encouraging innovations that harmonize technological advancement with meaningful societal benefit.</p></details> |  |

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM RecSys 2025; to appear</p></details> |
| **[World Model-Based Learning for Long-Term Age of Information Minimization in Vehicular Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01712v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network. Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network, which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26% improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23068v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.</p></details> | 33 pages |
