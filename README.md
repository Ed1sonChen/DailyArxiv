| **[TaF-VLA: Tactile-Force Alignment in Vision-Language-Action Models for Force-aware Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20321v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.</p></details> | 17pages,9fig |

Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5 suites and Mikasa-Robo, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, 96.5%, and 41.2% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge and +11.8 gain on Mikasa-Robo. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[TwinBrainVLA: Unleashing the Potential of Generalist VLMs for Embodied Tasks via Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14133v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fundamental premise of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is to harness the extensive general capabilities of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for generalized embodied intelligence. However, standard robotic fine-tuning inevitably disrupts the pre-trained feature space, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" that compromises the general visual understanding we aim to leverage. To effectively utilize the uncorrupted general capabilities of VLMs for robotic tasks, we propose TwinBrainVLA, which coordinates two isomorphic VLM pathways: a frozen generalist (also called "Left Brain") and a trainable specialist (also called "Right Brain"). Our architecture utilizes a Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism, enabling the Right Brain to dynamically query and fuse intact semantic knowledge from the Left Brain with proprioceptive states. This fused representation conditions a flow-matching action expert for precise continuous control. Empirical results on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that by explicitly retaining general capabilities, TwinBrainVLA achieves substantial performance gains over baseline models in complex manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/ZGC-EmbodyAI/TwinBrainVLA</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Models Unlock Task-Centric Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22714v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CARE: Multi-Task Pretraining for Latent Continuous Action Representation in Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22467v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for robot control, but their dependence on action supervision limits scalability and generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, humanoid robotics, and augmented reality. We analyzed challenges and propose solutions including agentic adaptation and cross-embodiment planning. Furthermore, we outline a forward-looking roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to strengthen socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work, is expected to serve as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence.

| **[DynamicVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Dynamic Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22153v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.infinitescript.com/project/dynamic-vla/ GitHub: https://github.com/hzxie/DynamicVLA</p></details> |
| **[MoE-ACT: Improving Surgical Imitation Learning Policies through Supervised Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21971v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[$π_\texttt{RL}$: Online RL Fine-tuning for Flow-based Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25889v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying RL to large-scale flow-based VLAs (\eg, $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods raised from flow matching. We address this challenge with $π_{\texttt{RL}}$, featuring two technical approaches: (1) \textbf{Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) \textbf{Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration. We evaluate $π_{\texttt{RL}}$ across various benchmarks, with experiments demonstrating that RL yields significant performance improvements in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoFreeVLA: Collision-Free Dual-Arm Manipulation via Vision-Language-Action Model and Risk Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21712v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts. It is pre-trained with model-based collision labels and posttrained on real robot rollouts for calibration. On five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm, CoFreeVLA reduces selfcollisions and improves success rates versus RDT and APEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIR-VLA: Vision-Language-Action Systems for Aerial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21602v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics. The resource of AIR-VLA will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AIR-VLA-dataset-B5CC/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring My Cup! Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20014v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup," where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with videos and code: https://vap-project.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[IROS: A Dual-Process Architecture for Real-Time VLM-Based Indoor Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21506v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</p></details> | Accepted by IV |
| **[Unifying Perception and Action: A Hybrid-Modality Pipeline with Implicit Visual Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19859v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallels Between VLA Model Post-Training and Human Motor Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Trends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20966v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging the strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to enhance an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the specified tasks. This perspective aligns with Newell's constraints-led theory of skill acquisition, which posits that motor behavior arises from interactions among task, environmental, and organismic (embodiment) constraints. Accordingly, this survey structures post-training methods into four categories: (i) enhancing environmental perception, (ii) improving embodiment awareness, (iii) deepening task comprehension, and (iv) multi-component integration. Experimental results on standard benchmarks are synthesized to distill actionable guidelines. Finally, open challenges and emerging trends are outlined, relating insights from human learning to prospective methods for VLA post-training. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

| **[Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20334v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

| **[Shallow-π: Knowledge Distillation for Flow-based VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20262v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for real-time robotic deployment necessitates fast and on-device inference for vision-language-action (VLA) models. Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Expanded systematic review; resubmitted to Robotics</p></details> |

We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197v4)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC^2-VLA: Action-Context-Aware Adaptive Computation in Vision-Language-Action Models for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19634v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation, yet their closed-loop deployment is hindered by the high latency and compute cost of repeatedly running large vision-language backbones at every timestep. We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vlaser: Vision-Language-Action Model with Synergistic Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11027v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Evaluation of Robotic Manipulation: A New Benchmark and AutoEval Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18723v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid evolution of Vision-Action and Vision-Language-Action models, imitation learning has significantly advanced robotic manipulation capabilities. However, evaluation methodologies have lagged behind, hindering the establishment of Trustworthy Evaluation for these behaviors. Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively. Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation. Our project and code are available at https://term-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-vla/, Code: https://github.com/Robbyant/lingbot-vla/</p></details> |

This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |

Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control. TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals. This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects. In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

| **[PEAfowl: Perception-Enhanced Multi-View Vision-Language-Action for Bimanual Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17885v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual manipulation in cluttered scenes requires policies that remain stable under occlusions, viewpoint and scene variations. Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding. In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors. On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.

| **[Motion Focus Recognition in Fast-Moving Egocentric Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07154v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to robotics, existing egocentric datasets primarily focus on action recognition tasks, while largely overlooking the inherent role of motion analysis in sports and other fast-movement scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. We leverage the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduce system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy. This work makes motion-centric analysis practical for edge deployment and offers a complementary perspective to existing egocentric studies on sports and fast-movement activities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPACE-CLIP: Spatial Perception via Adaptive CLIP Embeddings for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17657v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for semantic understanding but inherently struggles to perceive geometric structure. Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our model is available at https://github.com/taewan2002/space-clip</p></details> |  |
| **[ReViP: Reducing False Completion in Vision-Language-Action Models with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16667v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by combining vision, language, and proprioception to predict actions. However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.</p></details> |  |

The domains of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics have also undergone a similar phenomenon through the advent of large foundational models in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Language Action models (VLAs), respectively. In this paper, we investigate the current state of Artificial Intelligence for Database Systems research (AI4DB), and assess how far AI4DB systems are from achieving their own Move\,37 moment. We envision a Generative Database Agent (Gen-DBA, for short) as the pathway to achieving Move\,37 for database systems that will bring generative reasoning and creativity into the realm of database learning tasks. This vision paper explores this direction by presenting the recipe for building Gen-DBA that encompasses but is not limited to a Transformer backbone, a hardware-grounded tokenization mechanism, a two-stage Goal-Directed Next Token Prediction training paradigm, and a generative inference process.</p></details> |  |
| **[IVRA: Improving Visual-Token Relations for Robot Action Policy with Training-Free Hint-Based Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16207v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA</p></details> |  |
| **[Cosmos Policy: Fine-Tuning Video Models for Visuomotor Control and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16163v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks. We release code, models, and training data at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-policy/</p></details> |  |
| **[DTP: A Simple yet Effective Distracting Token Pruning Framework for Vision-Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16065v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research. We also publish our code at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CBD3.</p></details> |  |

The model is built upon the open-source pi0.5_base backbone, with the svla_so101_pickplace dataset preprocessed into a structured training corpus. An independently designed VLA architecture is introduced to integrate deep semantic understanding with associative reasoning, enabling telepathic-style alignment between perception and action. Training proceeds through iterative optimization of data preprocessing, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and inference-stage adapter design. Evaluation is conducted using offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma against the untuned pi0.5_base under identical data conditions. Experimental results indicate a consistent reduction in control MSE across vector-, fragment-, and trajectory-level scales, while preserving the stability of the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality. These findings demonstrate that mind-responsive alignment control can be quantitatively achieved through semantic and associative architectural integration without retraining the base model, providing a reproducible pathway for semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>The S...</summary><p>The Sigma model has been open-sourced on Hugging Face.

Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\% to 17.29\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs. We release our code, prompts, and force-torque-impedance-scenario context datasets at https://sites.google.com/view/compliantvla.</p></details> | under review |
| **[TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14945v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at LBR of HRI 2026 conference</p></details> |

In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models require substantial computational resources and sacrifice language generation capabilities to maximize efficiency, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained educational settings that require interpretable, explanation-generating systems. We present \textit{Pedagogical VLA Framework}, a framework that applies pedagogical alignment to lightweight VLA models through four components: text healing to restore language generation capabilities, large language model (LLM) distillation to transfer pedagogical knowledge, safety training for educational environments, and pedagogical evaluation adjusted to science education contexts. We evaluate Pedagogical VLA Framework across five science demonstrations spanning physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, using an evaluation framework developed in collaboration with science education experts. Our evaluation assesses both task performance (success rate, protocol compliance, efficiency, safety) and pedagogical quality through teacher surveys and LLM-as-Judge assessment. We additionally provide qualitative analysis of generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate that Pedagogical VLA Framework achieves comparable task performance to baseline models while producing contextually appropriate educational explanations.</p></details> |  |

We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate.</p></details> |  |

| **[Being-H0.5: Scaling Human-Centric Robot Learning for Cross-Embodiment Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12993v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Being-H0.5, a foundational Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model designed for robust cross-embodiment generalization across diverse robotic platforms. While existing VLAs often struggle with morphological heterogeneity and data scarcity, we propose a human-centric learning paradigm that treats human interaction traces as a universal "mother tongue" for physical interaction. To support this, we present UniHand-2.0, the largest embodied pre-training recipe to date, comprising over 35,000 hours of multimodal data across 30 distinct robotic embodiments. Our approach introduces a Unified Action Space that maps heterogeneous robot controls into semantically aligned slots, enabling low-resource robots to bootstrap skills from human data and high-resource platforms. Built upon this human-centric foundation, we design a unified sequential modeling and multi-task pre-training paradigm to bridge human demonstrations and robotic execution. Architecturally, Being-H0.5 utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformers design featuring a novel Mixture-of-Flow (MoF) framework to decouple shared motor primitives from specialized embodiment-specific experts. Finally, to make cross-embodiment policies stable in the real world, we introduce Manifold-Preserving Gating for robustness under sensory shift and Universal Async Chunking to universalize chunked control across embodiments with different latency and control profiles. We empirically demonstrate that Being-H0.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on simulated benchmarks, such as LIBERO (98.9%) and RoboCasa (53.9%), while also exhibiting strong cross-embodiment capabilities on five robotic platforms.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v6)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. The recent proliferation of VLAs necessitates a comprehensive survey to capture the rapidly evolving landscape. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing VLA-based control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. A curated repository associated with this survey is available at: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[Genie Centurion: Accelerating Scalable Real-World Robot Training with Human Rewind-and-Refine Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18793v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalizability in various tasks, real-world deployment of robotic policy still requires large-scale, high-quality human expert demonstrations. However, data collection via human teleoperation requires continuous operator attention, which is costly, hard to scale. To address this, we propose Genie Centurion (GCENT), a scalable and general data collection paradigm based on human rewind-and-refine guidance, enabling robots' interactive learning in deployment. GCENT starts at an imperfect policy and improves over time. When the robot execution failures occur, GCENT allows robots to revert to a previous state with a rewind mechanism, after which a teleoperator provides corrective demonstrations to refine the policy. This framework supports a one-human-to-many-robots supervision scheme with a Task Sentinel module, which autonomously predicts task success and solicits human intervention when necessary. Empirical results show that GCENT achieves up to 40% higher task success rates than state-of-the-art data collection methods, and reaches comparable performance using less than half the data in long-horizon and precise tasks. We also quantify the data yield-to-effort ratio under multi-robot scenarios, demonstrating GCENT's potential for scalable and cost-efficient robot policy training in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel, specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and execution. The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration. We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseOccVLA: Bridging Occupancy and Vision-Language Models via Sparse Queries for Unified 4D Scene Understanding and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06474v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Scenario Rollouts for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11475v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

| **[Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space. We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution. LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Framework of Key Performance Indicators for Multi-Robot Lunar and Planetary Field Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20529v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Geometrically-Grounded 3D Visual Representations for View-Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22988v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic manipulation demands visuomotor policies capable of robust spatial scene understanding and strong generalization across diverse camera viewpoints. While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[About an Automating Annotation Method for Robot Markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22982v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5 suites and Mikasa-Robo, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, 96.5%, and 41.2% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge and +11.8 gain on Mikasa-Robo. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[RoboArmGS: High-Quality Robotic Arm Splatting via Bézier Curve Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17961v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing photorealistic and controllable robotic arm digital assets from real observations is fundamental to robotic applications. Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model the actual motion captured in real-world observations, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assistive Robots and Reasonable Work Assignment Reduce Perceived Stigma toward Persons with Disabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22689v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are becoming more prominent in assisting persons with disabilities (PwD). Whilst there is broad consensus that robots can assist in mitigating physical impairments, the extent to which they can facilitate social inclusion remains equivocal. In fact, the exposed status of assisted workers could likewise lead to reduced or increased perceived stigma by other workers. We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot. In addition, offering robot-assisted work for everyone, in the sense of universal design, further reduces perceived cognitive stigma. Thus, we conclude that assistive robots reduce perceived cognitive stigma, thereby supporting the use of collaborative robots in work scenarios involving PwDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Companion Proceedings of the 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction</p></details> |
| **[Postural Virtual Fixtures for Ergonomic Physical Interactions with Supernumerary Robotic Bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22672v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conjoined collaborative robots, functioning as supernumerary robotic bodies (SRBs), can enhance human load tolerance abilities. However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The International Journal of Robotics Research</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |
| **[High-Definition 5MP Stereo Vision Sensing for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22445v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (5MP+) stereo vision systems are essential for advancing robotic capabilities, enabling operation over longer ranges and generating significantly denser and accurate 3D point clouds. However, realizing the full potential of high-angular-resolution sensors requires a commensurately higher level of calibration accuracy and faster processing -- requirements often unmet by conventional methods. This study addresses that critical gap by processing 5MP camera imagery using a novel, advanced frame-to-frame calibration and stereo matching methodology designed to achieve both high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to evaluate real-time performance by comparing real-time disparity maps with ground-truth disparity maps derived from more computationally intensive stereo matching algorithms. Crucially, the research demonstrates that high-pixel-count cameras yield high-quality point clouds only through the implementation of high-accuracy calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plant-Inspired Robot Design Metaphors for Ambient HRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22387v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants offer a paradoxical model for interaction: they are ambient, low-demand presences that nonetheless shape atmosphere, routines, and relationships through temporal rhythms and subtle expressions. In contrast, most human-robot interaction (HRI) has been grounded in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic paradigms, producing overt, high-demand forms of engagement. Using a Research through Design (RtD) methodology, we explore plants as metaphoric inspiration for HRI; we conducted iterative cycles of ideation, prototyping, and reflection to investigate what design primitives emerge from plant metaphors and morphologies, and how these primitives can be combined into expressive robotic forms. We present a suite of speculative, open-source prototypes that help probe plant-inspired presence, temporality, form, and gestures. We deepened our learnings from design and prototyping through prototype-centered workshops that explored people's perceptions and imaginaries of plant-inspired robots. This work contributes: (1) Set of plant-inspired robotic artifacts; (2) Designerly insights on how people perceive plant-inspired robots; and (3) Design consideration to inform how to use plant metaphors to reshape HRI.</p></details> |  |

We design and introduce Lantern, a minimalist robotic object platform to enable building simple robotic artifacts. We conducted in-depth design and engineering iterations of Lantern's mechatronic architecture to meet specific design goals while maintaining a low build cost (~40 USD). As an extendable, open-source platform, Lantern aims to enable exploration of a range of HRI scenarios by leveraging human tendency to assign social meaning to simple forms. To evaluate Lantern's potential for HRI, we conducted a series of explorations: 1) a co-design workshop, 2) a sensory room case study, 3) distribution to external HRI labs, 4) integration into a graduate-level HRI course, and 5) public exhibitions with older adults and children. Our findings show that Lantern effectively evokes engagement, can support versatile applications ranging from emotion regulation to focused work, and serves as a viable platform for lowering barriers to HRI as a field.</p></details> |  |

The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hardware experiments on a 1/10 car-like pusher demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

However, achieving robust and precise motion control with intense force interaction remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework that concurrently optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy via coupled training. We employ a constrained residual action space to improve dual-agent training stability and sample efficiency. The external tension disturbances are explicitly modeled using a spring-damper system, allowing for fine-grained force control through manipulation of the virtual spring. In this process, the reinforcement learning policy autonomously generates a disturbance-rejection response by utilizing environmental feedback. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves whole-body control for humanoid robots across diverse force-interaction environments using a single dual-agent policy, delivering outstanding performance under load-bearing and thrust-disturbance conditions, while maintaining stable operation even under rope suspension state.</p></details> |  |

| **[AsterNav: Autonomous Aerial Robot Navigation In Darkness Using Passive Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17550v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous aerial navigation in absolute darkness is crucial for post-disaster search and rescue operations, which often occur from disaster-zone power outages. Yet, due to resource constraints, tiny aerial robots, perfectly suited for these operations, are unable to navigate in the darkness to find survivors safely. In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\text{TM}$ Nano. Furthermore, our network is robust to changes in the structured light pattern and relative placement of the pattern emitter and IR camera, leading to simplified and cost-effective construction. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on monocular, structured-light-based quadrotor navigation in absolute darkness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Published in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-va Code: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-va</p></details> |

However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.</p></details> |  |

Game-based learning (GBL) and gamification offer engagement benefits, yet their comparative impact remains unclear. We present the first PRISMA-aligned systematic review and comparative synthesis of GBL and gamification in robotics education, analyzing 95 studies from 12,485 records across four databases (2014-2025). We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p < .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report. We propose eight research directions and a design space outlining best practices and pitfalls, offering actionable guidance for robotics education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at Proceedings of the 2026 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. 26 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables;</p></details> |

The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmboCoach-Bench: Benchmarking AI Agents on Developing Embodied Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21570v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |

By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System and Edge Computing Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02492v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial Internet environments, mobile robots must generate collision-free global routes under stochastic obstacle layouts and random perturbations in commanded linear and angular velocities. This paper models a differential-drive robot with nonholonomic constraints, then decomposes motion into obstacle avoidance, target turning, and target approaching behaviors to parameterize the control variables. Global path planning is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and converted into a weighted energy function that balances path length and collision penalties. A three-layer neural network represents the planning model, while simulated annealing searches for near-global minima and mitigates local traps. During execution, a fuzzy controller uses heading and lateral-offset errors to output wheel-speed differentials for rapid correction; edge-side computation is discussed to reduce robot-server traffic and latency. Matlab 2024 simulations report deviation within +-5 cm, convergence within 10 ms, and shorter paths than two baseline methods. The approach improves robustness of global navigation in practice.</p></details> |  |

Yet, obtaining accurate near-surface measurements remains hazardous and logistically challenging, motivating the need for autonomous solutions. Limited mobility in rough volcanic terrain has prevented wheeled systems from performing reliable in situ gas measurements, reducing their usefulness as sensing platforms. We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation. We evaluated the system on Mount Etna across three autonomous missions in varied terrain, achieving successful gas-source detections with autonomy rates of 93-100%. In addition, we conducted a teleoperated mission in which the robot measured natural fumaroles, detecting sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. We discuss lessons learned from the gas-analysis and autonomy perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive sensing strategies, tighter integration of global and local planning, and improved hardware design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Spotlighting Task-Relevant Features: Object-Centric Representations for Better Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21416v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALRM: Agentic LLM for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19510v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Perception and Action: A Hybrid-Modality Pipeline with Implicit Visual Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19859v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have achieved remarkable success in advancing general-purpose robotic agents, owing to its significant perceptual comprehension. Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\%, 9.6\% and 12.1\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstracting Robot Manipulation Skills via Mixture-of-Experts Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21251v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disturbance-Aware Flight Control of Robotic Gliding Blimp via Moving Mass Actuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21188v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR) 2026</p></details> |

While soft everting robots have been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through. Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m in length.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters Link to publication: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11359009 Citation: E.

This technology is anticipated to play a key role in the exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other planets. In this article, we share insights and lessons learned from C-SLAM experiments involving three robots operating on a Mars analogue terrain and communicating over an ad hoc network. We examine the impact of limited and intermittent communication on C-SLAM performance, as well as the unique localization challenges posed by planetary-like environments. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset collected during our experiments, which includes real-time peer-to-peer inter-robot throughput and latency measurements. This dataset aims to support future research on communication-constrained, decentralized multirobot operations.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose Meta-ROS, a novel middleware solution designed to streamline robotics development by simplifying integration, enhancing performance, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Meta-ROS leverages modern communication protocols, such as Zenoh and ZeroMQ, to enable efficient and low-latency communication across diverse hardware platforms, while also supporting various data types like audio, images, and video. We evaluated Meta-ROS's performance through comprehensive testing, comparing it with existing middleware frameworks like ROS1 and ROS2. The results demonstrated that Meta-ROS outperforms ROS2, achieving up to 30% higher throughput, significantly reducing message latency, and optimizing resource usage. Additionally, its robust hardware support and developer-centric design facilitate seamless integration and ease of use, positioning Meta-ROS as an ideal solution for modern, real-time robotics AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Checkout the Python Library - https://pypi.org/project/metaros/ To be Submitted in ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS) Journal</p></details> |

We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures.

The methodology encompasses several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and subtasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a knowledge graph, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A practical implementation within the Aerostack2 framework is demonstrated through a simulated search and rescue mission in a Gazebo environment, where drones autonomously locate a target. This implementation highlights the effectiveness of the methodology in improving decision-making and mission performance by leveraging knowledge graphs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPO: Growing Policy Optimization for Legged Robot Locomotion and Whole-Body Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20668v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged robots remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration. Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20577v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20334v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

| **[Legged Robot State Estimation Using Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter with a Neural Compensator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00344v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches.

| **[Embodied AI with Foundation Models for Mobile Service Robots: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20503v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models, have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Expanded systematic review; resubmitted to Robotics</p></details> |
| **[A Taylor Series Approach to Correct Localization Errors in Robotic Field Mapping using Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20149v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian models for regression of scalar fields, formulated under the assumption that measurement locations are perfectly known and the corresponding field measurements have Gaussian noise. However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Robot Execution with Masked Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20130v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method enables faster task execution, maintains robustness across varying delays, and consistently achieves higher completion rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

This study introduces a data-driven framework to assess trust using behavioral indicators. The framework employs a Preference-Based Optimization algorithm to generate trust-enhancing trajectories based on operator feedback. This feedback serves as ground truth for training machine learning models to predict trust levels from behavioral indicators. The framework was tested in a chemical industry scenario where a robot assisted a human operator in mixing chemicals. Machine learning models classified trust with over 80\% accuracy, with the Voting Classifier achieving 84.07\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.90. These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.</p></details> |  |

Navigation with a Robot for Blind People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19851v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy and independent navigation are vital to daily life but remain challenging for individuals with blindness. Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper accepted into CHI 2026</p></details> |

We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE VR 2026: GenAI-XR workshop</p></details> |

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Structured Over Scale: Learning Spatial Reasoning from Educational Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23251v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Evaluating and Analyzing Audio Language Model Sycophancy with SYAUDIO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23149v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Language Models (ALMs) have recently shown strong capabilities in unified reasoning over speech, sound, and natural language; yet they inherit behavioral issues observed in Large Language Models, including sycophancy--the tendency to agree with user assertions even when they contradict objective evidence. While sycophancy has been extensively studied in text and vision-language models, its manifestation in audio-conditioned reasoning remains largely unexplored, despite the need for ALMs to rely on auditory cues such as acoustic events, speaker characteristics, and speech rate. To address this gap, we introduce SYAUDIO, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating sycophancy in ALMs, consisting of 4,319 audio questions spanning Audio Perception, Audio Reasoning, Audio Math, and Audio Ethics. Built upon established audio benchmarks and augmented with TTS-generated arithmetic and moral reasoning tasks, SYAUDIO enables systematic evaluation across multiple domains and sycophancy types with carefully verified data quality. Furthermore, we analyze audio-specific sycophancy under realistic conditions involving noise and rate, and demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing sycophantic behavior in ALMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Narrow Gate: Localized Image-Text Communication in Native Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06646v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[One-shot Optimized Steering Vector for Hallucination Mitigation for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23041v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but still suffer from hallucination and safety-related failures that persist even at scale. Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{OSGA} (\textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{S}teering with \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that a single OSGA-optimized steering vector consistently improves hallucination mitigation and safety enhancement with negligible overhead, highlighting one-shot steering as a practical and scalable solution for reliable VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, standard robotic fine-tuning inevitably disrupts the pre-trained feature space, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" that compromises the general visual understanding we aim to leverage. To effectively utilize the uncorrupted general capabilities of VLMs for robotic tasks, we propose TwinBrainVLA, which coordinates two isomorphic VLM pathways: a frozen generalist (also called "Left Brain") and a trainable specialist (also called "Right Brain"). Our architecture utilizes a Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism, enabling the Right Brain to dynamically query and fuse intact semantic knowledge from the Left Brain with proprioceptive states. This fused representation conditions a flow-matching action expert for precise continuous control. Empirical results on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that by explicitly retaining general capabilities, TwinBrainVLA achieves substantial performance gains over baseline models in complex manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/ZGC-EmbodyAI/TwinBrainVLA</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Alignment among Language, Vision and Action Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22948v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Street View to Visibility Network: Mapping Urban Visual Relationships with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11809v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location. Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore, it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably, bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections. Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis, and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.</p></details> |  |

This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Web Conference 2026.

At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models for 2D Object Detection under SOTIF Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22830v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable environmental perception remains one of the main obstacles for safe operation of automated vehicles. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 11 figures |

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeatMat: Simulation of City Material Impact on Urban Heat Island Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22796v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, defined as a significant increase in temperature in urban environments compared to surrounding areas, is difficult to study in real cities using sensor data (satellites or in-situ stations) due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution. Among the factors contributing to this effect are the properties of urban materials, which differ from those in rural areas. To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[Procedural Knowledge Extraction from Industrial Troubleshooting Guides Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22754v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial troubleshooting guides encode diagnostic procedures in flowchart-like diagrams where spatial layout and technical language jointly convey meaning. To integrate this knowledge into operator support systems, which assist shop-floor personnel in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues, the information must first be extracted and structured for machine interpretation. However, when performed manually, this extraction is labor-intensive and error-prone. Vision Language Models offer potential to automate this process by jointly interpreting visual and textual meaning, yet their performance on such guides remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two VLMs on extracting structured knowledge, comparing two prompting strategies: standard instruction-guided versus an augmented approach that cues troubleshooting layout patterns. Results reveal model-specific trade-offs between layout sensitivity and semantic robustness, informing practical deployment decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamSense: Streaming Social Task Detection with Selective Vision-Language Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22738v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Live streaming platforms require real-time monitoring and reaction to social signals, utilizing partial and asynchronous evidence from video, text, and audio. We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, The Web Conference 2026</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

| **[Vision-Language Models Unlock Task-Centric Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22714v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for the 2026 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)</p></details> |
| **[Best-of-Q: Improving VLM agents with Q-function Action Ranking at Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22701v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-MCQ: Reformulating Vision-Language Alignment for Negation Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22696v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong zero-shot performance via large-scale image-text pretraining and have been widely adopted in medical image analysis. However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICPR 2026 (under review)</p></details> |
| **[AlignGemini: Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection Through Task-Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06746v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used for detecting AI-generated images (AIGI). However, converting VLMs into reliable detectors is resource-intensive, and the resulting models often suffer from hallucination and poor generalization. To investigate the root cause, we conduct an empirical analysis and identify two consistent behaviors. First, fine-tuning VLMs with semantic supervision improves semantic discrimination and generalizes well to unseen data. Second, fine-tuning VLMs with pixel-artifact supervision leads to weak generalization. These findings reveal a fundamental task-model misalignment. VLMs are optimized for high-level semantic reasoning and lack inductive bias toward low-level pixel artifacts. In contrast, conventional vision models effectively capture pixel-level artifacts but are less sensitive to semantic inconsistencies. This indicates that different models are naturally suited to different subtasks. Based on this insight, we formulate AIGI detection as two orthogonal subtasks: semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection. Neglecting either subtask leads to systematic detection failures. We further propose the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it in a two-branch detector, AlignGemini. The detector combines a VLM trained with pure semantic supervision and a vision model trained with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing clear specialization, each branch captures complementary cues. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks show that AlignGemini improves average accuracy by 9.5 percent using simplified training data. These results demonstrate that task-model alignment is an effective principle for generalizable AIGI detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Pose Problems: Reasoning-Driven and Solver-Adaptive Data Synthesis for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09907v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data are used to bootstrap problem-design strategies in the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our proposed framework achieves a cumulative average improvement of 3.4%, demonstrating robust generalization across both language and vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameOracle: Learning What to See and How Much to See in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03584v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) advance video understanding but operate under tight computational budgets, making performance dependent on selecting a small, high-quality subset of frames. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, fail to adapt to variations in content density or task complexity. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained via a curriculum that progresses from weak proxy signals, such as cross-modal similarity, to stronger supervision with FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA dataset with validated keyframe annotations specifying minimal sufficient frames per question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks show that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without accuracy loss. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces inputs to 13.9 frames on average while improving accuracy by 1.5%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Liushiyu-0709/SelfVal</p></details> |

Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, humanoid robotics, and augmented reality. We analyzed challenges and propose solutions including agentic adaptation and cross-embodiment planning. Furthermore, we outline a forward-looking roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to strengthen socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work, is expected to serve as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence.

However, their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt variations, which can reveal vulnerabilities in safety alignment. In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-strategy significantly improves ASR while maintaining naturalness in both text and visual domains.</p></details> |  |

Safety mechanisms, while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25pag...</summary><p>25pages, 15 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

However, incorporating vision data significantly increases the prompt length, resulting in a longer time to first token (TTFT). This bottleneck can be alleviated by leveraging the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. Analyzing these attention patterns in VLMs when processing a series of images, we observe the absence of inter-image attention in a substantial portion of layers. Based on this, we propose BlindSight: an approach to optimize multi-image VLM inference using an input-template-aware attention sparsity mask with no runtime overhead. We utilize a dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic categorization for attention heads: Dense, Sink, Intra-Image, and Intra-Image+Sink. We develop a Triton-based GPU kernel to leverage this sparsity. BlindSight achieves a 1.8-3.2x speedup in the attention computation (prompt length 36K-300K). BlindSight generalizes across VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Gemma 3), with only a 0.78% absolute accuracy degradation on average on multi-image comprehension benchmarks. Finally, we advocate for the design of efficient VLMs that combine BlindSight-inspired sparse and dense layers.</p></details> |  |

DG is crucial for deploying vision-language models (VLMs) in real-world applications, yet most existing methods rely on domain labels that may not be available and often ambiguous. We instead study the DG setting where models must generalize well without access to explicit domain labels. Our key idea is to represent an unseen target domain as a combination of latent domains automatically discovered from training data, enabling the model to adaptively transfer knowledge across domains. To realize this, we perform latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text features based on the similarity between the input image and each latent domain. Experiments on four benchmarks show that this strategy yields consistent gains over VLM-based baselines and provides new insights into improving robustness under domain shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22228v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$). Moreover, VLMs exhibit difficulty in multi-image reasoning, with inconsistent performance (best $59.7\%$) when integrating spatial cues across frames. Our findings reveal limitations in grounding VLMs in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22150v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21821v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Vector Weakening: Efficient Training-free Unlearning for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21794v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Weakly-Supervised Learning and VLM Distillation: Noisy Partial Label Learning for Efficient Downstream Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03229v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, leveraging these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation and enable annotation-free training has become a promising research direction. This paper studies learning from noisy partial labels generated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes a collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) framework. Unlike symmetric noise commonly assumed in traditional noisy label learning, VLM-generated noise is instance-dependent and reflects the intrinsic biases of pre-trained models, posing greater challenges. To address this issue, we jointly train two neural networks to perform collaborative label purification via a co-pseudo-labeling mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization in both label and feature representation spaces. In addition, multiple anti-overfitting strategies are introduced, including alternating optimization of contrastive representations and pseudo-labels, as well as maintaining class prototypes in a shared feature space. The proposed method can further incorporate few-shot manually annotated labels for performance enhancement. Extensive experiments under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of integrating weakly supervised learning into the knowledge distillation of pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification for Pre-trained VLMs via Riemannian Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21662v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCRVerse: Towards Holistic OCR in End-to-End Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21639v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.</p></details> |  |

A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026. 10 pages.

However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the number of inference tokens increases. This work addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. The first stage (normalisation) refines standard attention by replacing Softmax with the more numerically stable Softplus followed by $l_{1}$-normalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy. We show that this novel attention mechanism outperforms conventional Softmax attention, and state-of-the-art Softmax-free alternatives. Our second proposal is to introduce a second processing stage (sharpening) which consists of a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attentional weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens, mitigating the attention sink phenomenon, and fundamentally improving length extrapolation. This novel, two-stage, replacement for self-attention is shown to ensure numerical stability and dramatically improve length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and downstream benchmarks. Furthermore, symbolic regression experiments demonstrate that our method enables models to recover Newton's gravitational law from orbital trajectory sequences, providing evidence that appropriate attention mechanisms are crucial for foundation models to develop genuine physical world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages for ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Policy-Driven World Model Adaptation for Robust Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13709v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00559v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to structure and reason about implicit social contexts, as they lack explicit representations for unobserved dynamics such as intentions, beliefs, and evolving social states. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social world models (SWMs) to characterize the complex social dynamics. To operationalize SWMs, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), which captures the evolving states, actions, and mental states of agents, addressing the lack of explicit structure in traditional free-text-based inputs. Through comprehensive experiments across five social reasoning benchmarks, we show that S3AP significantly enhances LLM performance-achieving a +51% improvement on FANToM over OpenAI's o1. Our ablations further reveal that these gains are driven by the explicit modeling of hidden mental states, which proves more effective than a wide range of baseline methods. Finally, we introduce an algorithm for social world models using S3AP, which enables AI agents to build models of their interlocutors and predict their next actions and mental states. Empirically, S3AP-enabled social world models yield up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA multi-turn social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.</p></details> |  |

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22128v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.</p></details> |  |

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-va Code: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-va</p></details> |

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project's code can be found at https://github.com/flowersteam/WorldLLM.

| **[PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://world-bench.github.io/</p></details> |

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p></details> |  |

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story.

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, 10 pages main text, 21 pages appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |

We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19834v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thuml.github.io/Reasoning-Visual-World</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Design Patterns: A System-Theoretic Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19752v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our "RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three challenging, stochastic tokamak control tasks.

However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Observations to Events: Event-Aware World Model for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19336v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2026.

Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a generalized operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to non-equivariant systems while retaining spectral efficiency and grid invariance. To exploit GSNO, we develop SHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and SHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. The theoretical and experimental results position GSNO as a principled and generalized framework for spherical operator design and learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.</p></details> |  |

Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control. TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals. This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects. In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</p></details> |  |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis.

| **[Beyond Static Datasets: Robust Offline Policy Optimization via Vetted Synthetic Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18107v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) holds immense promise for safety-critical domains like industrial robotics, where real-time environmental interaction is often prohibitive. A primary obstacle in ORL remains the distributional shift between the static dataset and the learned policy, which typically mandates high degrees of conservatism that can restrain potential policy improvements. We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent synthesis. Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes. We further provide insights into the role of the VAE as a geometric anchor and discuss the distributional trade-offs encountered when learning from near-optimal datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Current methods face three limitations: Low sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, poor generalization in imitation learning, and physical inconsistency in VLMs. We propose MetaWorld, a hierarchical world model that integrates semantic planning and physical control via expert policy transfer. The framework decouples tasks into a VLM-driven semantic layer and a latent dynamics model operating in a compact state space. Our dynamic expert selection and motion prior fusion mechanism leverages a pre-trained multi-expert policy library as transferable knowledge, enabling efficient online adaptation via a two-stage framework. VLMs serve as semantic interfaces, mapping instructions to executable skills and bypassing symbol grounding. Experiments on Humanoid-Bench show MetaWorld outperforms world model-based RL in task completion and motion coherence. Our code will be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/metaworld-2BF4/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICLR 2026 World Model Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Device-Native Autonomous Agents for Privacy-Preserving Negotiations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00911v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables, Submitted to IEEE SoutheastCon 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Task Aware Dreamer for Task Generalization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05092v5)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal of reinforcement learning is to acquire agents that can learn on training tasks and generalize well on unseen tasks that may share a similar dynamic but with different reward functions. The ability to generalize across tasks is important as it determines an agent's adaptability to real-world scenarios where reward mechanisms might vary. In this work, we first show that training a general world model can utilize similar structures in these tasks and help train more generalizable agents. Extending world models into the task generalization setting, we introduce a novel method named Task Aware Dreamer (TAD), which integrates reward-informed features to identify consistent latent characteristics across tasks. Within TAD, we compute the variational lower bound of sample data log-likelihood, which introduces a new term designed to differentiate tasks using their states, as the optimization objective of our reward-informed world models. To demonstrate the advantages of the reward-informed policy in TAD, we introduce a new metric called Task Distribution Relevance (TDR) which quantitatively measures the relevance of different tasks. For tasks exhibiting a high TDR, i.e., the tasks differ significantly, we illustrate that Markovian policies struggle to distinguish them, thus it is necessary to utilize reward-informed policies in TAD. Extensive experiments in both image-based and state-based tasks show that TAD can significantly improve the performance of handling different tasks simultaneously, especially for those with high TDR, and display a strong generalization ability to unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boltzmann-GPT: Bridging Energy-Based World Models and Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17094v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent text, yet whether they truly understand the world or merely produce plausible language about it remains contested. We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mechanistic View on Video Generation as World Models: State and Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17067v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cosmos Policy: Fine-Tuning Video Models for Visuomotor Control and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16163v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks. We release code, models, and training data at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-policy/</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysicsMind: Sim and Real Mechanics Benchmarking for Physical Reasoning and Prediction in Foundational VLMs and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16007v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generative Engines to Actionable Simulators: The Imperative of Physical Grounding in World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15533v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Walk through Paintings: Egocentric World Models from Internet Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15284v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableWorld: Towards Stable and Consistent Long Interactive Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15281v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 21 figures,</p></details> |

A Complete Survey on Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05131v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of video generation from text, from animating MNIST to simulating the world with Sora, has progressed at a breakneck speed. Here, we systematically discuss how far text-to-video generation technology supports essential requirements in world modeling. We curate 250+ studies on text-based video synthesis and world modeling. We then observe that recent models increasingly support spatial, action, and strategic intelligences in world modeling through adherence to completeness, consistency, invention, as well as human interaction and control. We conclude that text-to-video generation is adept at world modeling, although homework in several aspects, such as the diversity-consistency trade-offs, remains to be addressed.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First complete survey on Text-to-Video Generation from World Model perspective, 35 pages</p></details> |
| **[GraphPerf-RT: A Graph-Driven Performance Model for Hardware-Aware Scheduling of OpenMP Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12091v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous AI agents on embedded platforms require real-time, risk-aware scheduling under resource and thermal constraints. Classical heuristics struggle with workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) risks overheating. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **["Just in Time" World Modeling Supports Human Planning and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14514v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VJEPA: Variational Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures as Probabilistic World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14354v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.</p></details> | 77 pages |
