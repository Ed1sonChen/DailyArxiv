| **[WAM-Flow: Parallel Coarse-to-Fine Motion Planning via Discrete Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06112v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14396v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026, the Project website is available at https://qhemu.github.io/CCoL/</p></details> |
| **[RoboNeuron: A Modular Framework Linking Foundation Models and ROS for Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10394v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current embodied AI systems face severe engineering impediments, primarily characterized by poor cross-scenario adaptability, rigid inter-module coupling, and fragmented inference acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16203v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[HiF-VLA: Hindsight, Insight and Foresight through Motion Representation for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09928v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hifvla.github.io Github: https://github.com/OpenHelix-Team/HiF-VLA</p></details> |
| **[Token Expand-Merge: Training-Free Token Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09927v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets have emerged as powerful foundations for robotic perception and control. However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models. The code is public available on \href{https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/TEAM-VLA}{https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/TEAM-VLA}</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[UniUGP: Unifying Understanding, Generation, and Planing For End-to-end Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09864v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) systems struggle in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling. Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://seed-uniugp.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GLaD: Geometric Latent Distillation for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09619v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely primarily on RGB information, while ignoring geometric cues crucial for spatial reasoning and manipulation. In this work, we introduce GLaD, a geometry-aware VLA framework that incorporates 3D geometric priors during pretraining through knowledge distillation. Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind to Hand: Purposeful Robotic Control via Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08580v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans act with context and intention, with reasoning playing a central role. While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning ("mind") with robot action ("hand"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.</p></details> | 49 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Control Your Robot: A Unified System for Robot Control and Policy Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23823v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-platform robot control remains difficult because hardware interfaces, data formats, and control paradigms vary widely, which fragments toolchains and slows deployment. To address this, we present Control Your Robot, a modular, general-purpose framework that unifies data collection and policy deployment across diverse platforms. The system reduces fragmentation through a standardized workflow with modular design, unified APIs, and a closed-loop architecture. It supports flexible robot registration, dual-mode control with teleoperation and trajectory playback, and seamless integration from multimodal data acquisition to inference. Experiments on single-arm and dual-arm systems show efficient, low-latency data collection and effective support for policy learning with imitation learning and vision-language-action models. Policies trained on data gathered by Control Your Robot match expert demonstrations closely, indicating that the framework enables scalable and reproducible robot learning across platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Tian-Nian/control_your_robot</p></details> |
| **[Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Robot Policies via Parameter Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08333v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Time Action Conditioning for Efficient Real-Time Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05964v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time chunking (RTC) enables vision-language-action models (VLAs) to generate smooth, reactive robot trajectories by asynchronously predicting action chunks and conditioning on previously committed actions via inference-time inpainting. However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-ACT: Learn from Multimodal Parallel Generation to Act](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00975v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning. We release our codes, models and data at https://github.com/HHYHRHY/MM-ACT.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[See Once, Then Act: Vision-Language-Action Model with Task Learning from One-Shot Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07582v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robust and general-purpose manipulation policies represents a fundamental objective in robotics research. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos. Real-world experiments demonstrate effective learning from human videos, yielding more than 38% improvement on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Field Intervention: Enabling VLAs to Escape Memory Traps in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07472v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great performance in robotic manipulation by mapping visual observations and language instructions directly to actions. However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the "Memory Trap". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FASTer: Toward Efficient Autoregressive Vision Language Action Modeling via Neural Action Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04952v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videovla-nips2025.github.io</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN identifies contextually prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to train EFN, ensuring that the predicted actions align with past behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience". Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. We provide code and demo in our supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE-VLA: Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05693v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhiyingDu/HiMoE-VLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world, increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method, real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and "inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast, performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the presence of significant latency.

However, current VLA models typically contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks. In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1 achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite, surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations, Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/Evo-1</p></details> |

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited set of behaviors, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leveraging dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/SONIC/</p></details> |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Vision Language Action Model Using Success and Failure Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03913v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vine-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.</p></details> |  |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Vision-Language-Action Models as Anti-Exploration: A Test-Time Scaling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02834v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.</p></details> | 27 Pages, 21 figures |

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged.

However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize reliably in out-of-distribution deployments, where unavoidable disturbances such as observation noise, sensor errors, or actuation perturbations become prevalent. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training provides a practical means to adapt pre-trained VLA models, existing methods mainly emphasize reward maximization and overlook robustness to environmental uncertainty. In this work, we introduce RobustVLA, a lightweight online RL post-training method designed to explicitly enhance the resilience of VLA models. Through a systematic robustness analysis, we identify two key regularizations: Jacobian regularization, which mitigates sensitivity to observation noise, and smoothness regularization, which stabilizes policies under action perturbations. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic environments demonstrate that RobustVLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reliability. Our results highlight the importance of principled robustness-aware RL post-training as a key step toward improving the reliability and robustness of VLA models.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://isee-laboratory.github.io/OmniDexGrasp/</p></details> |
| **[SRPO: Self-Referential Policy Optimization for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15605v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://giga-world-0.github.io/</p></details> |

Vision-language models offer strong semantic understanding but lack embodiment-aware action capabilities while relying on hand-crafted skills. Vision-Language-Action policies enable reactive manipulation but remain brittle across embodiments, weak in geometric grounding, and devoid of proactive collaboration mechanisms. These limitations indicate that scaling a single model alone cannot deliver reliable autonomy for service robots operating in human-populated settings. To address this gap, we present InteractGen, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation, treating foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective. Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration, providing evidence that multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[When Robots Obey the Patch: Universal Transferable Patch Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21192v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.</p></details> |  |

| **[Iterative Compositional Data Generation for Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10891v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.</p></details> |  |

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project website, see https://genmimic.github.io</p></details> |

Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |

Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications.

In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10477v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.</p></details> |  |

Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.</p></details> | 15 Pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multi-Robot Path Planning Combining Heuristics and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01270v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot path finding in dynamic environments is a highly challenging classic problem. In the movement process, robots need to avoid collisions with other moving robots while minimizing their travel distance. Previous methods for this problem either continuously replan paths using heuristic search methods to avoid conflicts or choose appropriate collision avoidance strategies based on learning approaches. The former may result in long travel distances due to frequent replanning, while the latter may have low learning efficiency due to low sample exploration and utilization, and causing high training costs for the model. To address these issues, we propose a path planning method, MAPPOHR, which combines heuristic search, empirical rules, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method consists of two layers: a real-time planner based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, MAPPO, which embeds empirical rules in the action output layer and reward functions, and a heuristic search planner used to create a global guiding path. During movement, the heuristic search planner replans new paths based on the instructions of the real-time planner. We tested our method in 10 different conflict scenarios. The experiments show that the planning performance of MAPPOHR is better than that of existing learning and heuristic methods. Due to the utilization of empirical knowledge and heuristic search, the learning efficiency of MAPPOHR is higher than that of existing learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2025) https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/acra/acra2025_proceedings/views/includes/files/pap149s2.pdf</p></details> |

This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system that enables humanoid robots to execute robust continual ball-kicking with adaptability to different ball-goal configurations. The system extends a typical teacher-student training framework -- in which a "teacher" policy is trained with ground truth state information and the "student" learns to mimic it with noisy, imperfect sensing -- by including four training stages: (1) long-distance ball chasing (teacher); (2) directional kicking (teacher); (3) teacher policy distillation (student); and (4) student adaptation and refinement (student). Key design elements -- including tailored reward functions, realistic noise modeling, and online constrained RL for adaptation and refinement -- are critical for closing the sim-to-real gap and sustaining performance under perceptual uncertainty. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and on a real robot demonstrate strong kicking accuracy and goal-scoring success across diverse ball-goal configurations. Ablation studies further highlight the necessity of the constrained RL, noise modeling, and the adaptation stage. This work presents a system for learning robust continual humanoid ball-kicking under imperfect perception, establishing a benchmark task for visuomotor skill learning in humanoid whole-body control.</p></details> |  |

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: NeurIPS 2025 (main)</p></details> |

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/structuresComp/dismech-python</p></details> |

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06115v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected some formatting errors</p></details> |

While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning ("mind") with robot action ("hand"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.</p></details> | 49 pages, 25 figures |

While prior research demonstrates that eye-tracking features reliably estimate comfort in human-human interactions, their applicability to interactions with humanoid robots remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate user comfort with the robot "Ameca" across four experimentally controlled distances (0.5 m to 2.0 m) using mobile eye-tracking and subjective reporting (N=19). We evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning models to estimate comfort based on gaze features. Contrary to previous human-human studies where Transformer models excelled, a Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance (F1-score = 0.73), with minimum pupil diameter identified as the most critical predictor. These findings suggest that physiological comfort thresholds in human-robot interaction differ from human-human dynamics and can be effectively modeled using interpretable logic.</p></details> |  |

The system comprises four simulation-trained modules: three reinforcement-learning (RL) policies for locomotion, safety shielding, and navigation, and a transformer-based exteroceptive estimator that processes raw point-cloud inputs. This modular decomposition of complex legged motor-control tasks enables lightweight neural networks with simple architectures, trained using standard RL practices with targeted reward shaping and curriculum design, without reliance on heuristics or sophisticated policy-switching mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive ablations to validate our design choices and demonstrate improved robustness compared to existing approaches in challenging navigation tasks. The resulting reactive safe navigation (REASAN) system achieves fully onboard and real-time reactive navigation across both single- and multi-robot settings in complex environments.

We also introduce ViTA-SimData, a photo-realistic synthetic dataset tailored to industrial bin-picking scenario. Extensive experiments on two amodal benchmarks, COOCA and KINS, demonstrate that ViTA-Seg Dual Head achieves strong amodal and occlusion segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency, enabling robust, real-time robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

For elderly people with impaired physical abilities, support for toileting is one of the most important issues. This paper details the design, development, experimental assessment, and potential application of the gripper system, with a focus on the unique requirements and obstacles involved in aiding elderly or hemiplegic individuals in dressing and undressing trousers. The gripper we propose seeks to find the right balance between compliance and grasping forces, ensuring precise manipulation while maintaining a safe and compliant interaction with the users. The gripper's integration into a custom--built robotic manipulator system provides a comprehensive solution for assisting hemiplegic individuals in their dressing and undressing tasks. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing studies demonstrate the gripper's ability to successfully assist in both dressing and dressing of trousers in confined spaces with a high success rate. This research contributes to the advancement of assistive robotics, empowering elderly, and physically impaired individuals to maintain their independence and improve their quality of life.</p></details> |  |

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3D's depth reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while the zero-shot evaluations of SAM 3D on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Masked Generative Policy for Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09101v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.</p></details> |  |

The recognition of a user operator's affective states in remote robot control scenarios is, however, underexplored. Current emotion recognition methods rely on reading the user's vital signs or body language, but the devices and user participation these measures require would add limitations to remote robot control. We demonstrate that the functional movements of a remote-controlled robotic avatar, which was not designed for emotional expression, can be used to infer the emotional state of the human operator via a machine-learning system. Specifically, our system achieved 83.3$\%$ accuracy in recognizing the user's emotional state expressed by robot movements, as a result of their hand motions. We discuss the implications of this system on prominent current and future remote robot operation and affective robotic contexts.</p></details> |  |

We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes. We release complete hardware designs, firmware, and assembly instructions to support community adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://jessicayin.github.io/osmo_tactile_glove/</p></details> |

Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization ("patrollers" and "searchers") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SAC '26.

Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging. These results demonstrate that combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SII 2026. 6 pages, 7 figures.

With the growing adoption of industrial automation, online bin packing has gained increasing attention. However, inconsistencies in problem settings, test datasets, and evaluation metrics have hindered progress in the field, and there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system. Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing. The benchmark comprises three carefully designed test settings and extends existing evaluation metrics with new metrics for structural stability and operational safety. We design a scoring system and derive a range of insights from the evaluation results. RoboBPP is fully open-source and is equipped with visualization tools and an online leaderboard, providing a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research and industrial applications (https://robot-bin-packing-benchmark.github.io).</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation. Moreover, using the motion representation narrows the feature distance between action tokens and standard vocabulary tokens, mitigating modality gaps. Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves generalization performance and transferability in robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we combine the scalability and speed of modern multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms with the dynamic-awareness of kinodynamic planners to address these limitations. To this end, we propose discontinuity-Bounded LaCAM (db-LaCAM), a planner that utilizes a precomputed set of motion primitives that respect robot dynamics to generate horizon-length motion sequences, while allowing a user-defined discontinuity between successive motions. The planner db-LaCAM is resolution-complete with respect to motion primitives and supports arbitrary robot dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that db-LaCAM scales efficiently to scenarios with up to 50 robots, achieving up to ten times faster runtime compared to state-of-the-art planners, while maintaining comparable solution quality. The approach is validated in both 2D and 3D environments with dynamics such as the unicycle and 3D double integrator. We demonstrate the safe execution of trajectories planned with db-LaCAM in two distinct physical experiments involving teams of flying robots and car-with-trailer robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prospect Theory in Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Pilot Study of Probability Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08481v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how humans respond to uncertainty is critical for designing safe and effective physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), as physically working with robots introduces multiple sources of uncertainty, including trust, comfort, and perceived safety. Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\% to 90\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a "trade-off" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an "always-compensate" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

This study empirically tests the applicability of Fitts' List within physical Human-Robot Collaboration, by conducting a user study (N=26, within-subject design) to evaluate four distinct allocations of position/force control between human and robot in an abstract blending task. We hypothesize that the function in which humans control the position achieves better performance and receives higher user ratings. When allocating position control to the human and force control to the robot, compared to the opposite case, we observed a significant improvement in preventing overblending. This was also perceived better in terms of physical demand and overall system acceptance, while participants experienced greater autonomy, more engagement and less frustration. An interesting insight was that the supervisory role (when the robot controls both position and force) was rated second best in terms of subjective acceptance. Another surprising insight was that if position control was delegated to the robot, the participants perceived much lower autonomy than when the force control was delegated to the robot. These findings empirically support applying Fitts' principles to static function allocation for physical collaboration, while also revealing important nuanced user experience trade-offs, particularly regarding perceived autonomy when delegating position control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, col. 11, no. 1, January 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mediating Personal Relationships with Robotic Pets for Fostering Human-Human Interaction of Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08426v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Good human relationships are important for us to have a happy life and maintain our well-being. Otherwise, we will be at risk of experiencing loneliness or depression. In human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), robotic systems offer nuanced approaches to foster human connection, providing interaction beyond the traditional mediums that smartphones and computers offer. However, many existing studies primarily focus on the humanrobot relationships that older adults form directly with robotic pets rather than exploring how these robotic pets can enhance human-human relationships. Our ethnographic study investigates how robotic pets can be designed to facilitate human relationships. Through semi-structured interviews with six older adults and thematic analysis, our empirical findings provide insights into how robotic pets can be designed as telerobots to connect with others remotely, thus contributing to advance future development of robotic systems for mental health.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Robot Manipulation from Audio World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08405v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have demonstrated impressive performance on robotic learning tasks. Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Robot Policies via Parameter Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08333v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate QMIX and IPPO on the Robotic Warehouse (RWARE) environment and a custom Unity 3D simulation. Our experiments reveal that QMIX's value decomposition significantly outperforms independent learning approaches (achieving 3.25 mean return vs. 0.38 for advanced IPPO), but requires extensive hyperparameter tuning -- particularly extended epsilon annealing (5M+ steps) for sparse reward discovery. We demonstrate successful deployment in Unity ML-Agents, achieving consistent package delivery after 1M training steps.

| **[Semantic-Metric Bayesian Risk Fields: Learning Robot Safety from Human Videos with a VLM Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08233v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans interpret safety not as a binary signal but as a continuous, context- and spatially-dependent notion of risk. While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

| **[Geometry-Aware Sparse Depth Sampling for High-Fidelity RGB-D Depth Completion in Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08229v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.</p></details> |  |

We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIJIT: A Robotic Head for an Active Observer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07998v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DIJIT, a novel binocular robotic head expressly designed for mobile agents that behave as active observers. DIJIT's unique breadth of functionality enables active vision research and the study of human-like eye and head-neck motions, their interrelationships, and how each contributes to visual ability. DIJIT is also being used to explore the differences between how human vision employs eye/head movements to solve visual tasks and current computer vision methods. DIJIT's design features nine mechanical degrees of freedom, while the cameras and lenses provide an additional four optical degrees of freedom. The ranges and speeds of the mechanical design are comparable to human performance. Our design includes the ranges of motion required for convergent stereo, namely, vergence, version, and cyclotorsion. The exploration of the utility of these to both human and machine vision is ongoing. Here, we present the design of DIJIT and evaluate aspects of its performance. We present a new method for saccadic camera movements. In this method, a direct relationship between camera orientation and motor values is developed. The resulting saccadic camera movements are close to human movements in terms of their accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://intchous.github.io/DuetSVG-site</p></details> |

Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

| **[Fairness-Aware Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Medical Glaucoma Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03477v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms. Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 tables |

Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |

This leaves broader training scenarios and resources underexplored, limiting the exploration and learning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through RL. We find video games inherently provide rich visual elements and mechanics that are easy to verify. To fully use the multimodal and verifiable reward in video games, we propose Game-RL, constructing diverse game tasks for RL training to boost VLMs general reasoning ability. To obtain training data, we propose Code2Logic, a novel approach that adapts game code to synthesize game reasoning task data, thus obtaining the GameQA dataset of 30 games and 158 tasks with controllable difficulty gradation. Unexpectedly, RL training solely on GameQA enables multiple VLMs to achieve performance improvements across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating the value of Game-RL for enhancing VLMs' general reasoning. Furthermore, this suggests that video games may serve as valuable scenarios and resources to boost general reasoning abilities. Our code, dataset and models are available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | 69 pages, 24 figures |
| **[SpaceDrive: Infusing Spatial Awareness into VLM-based Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10719v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text (3 figures, 3 tables), 31 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[DOCR-Inspector: Fine-Grained and Automated Evaluation of Document Parsing with VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10619v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/ZZZZZQT/DOCR-Inspector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: A Training-Free, Text-to-Text Framework for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10596v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |

Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to address this issue in an unsupervised manner, yet existing methods, which rely on self-supervision, are prone to an inherent self-referential feedback loop that amplifies initial prediction errors, leading to model drift. We revisit this limitation and propose Test-Time Distillation (TTD), which reframes adaptation as a distillation process guided by a frozen Vision-Language Model (VLM) as an external signal. While promising, we find that direct distillation is fraught with two pitfalls: the Generalist Trap, where the VLM's broad but non-specialized knowledge leads to suboptimal performance on specific tasks and shifts, and the Entropy Bias, where naive model fusion techniques based on entropy fail due to the disparate calibration of heterogeneous models. These pitfalls motivate our insight: the key is to build a robust supervisory signal and leverage it to guide the target model toward stable adaptation. Hence, we present CoDiRe, a Continual Distillation and Rectification framework for TTD. CoDiRe first constructs a robust blended teacher by dynamically fusing the predictions of the VLM and the target model. Critically, it circumvents the Entropy Bias by leveraging Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) as a more reliable confidence metric for weighting each model's expertise. Then applies an Optimal Transport based rectification to further align predictions with the blended teacher, enabling continuous and stable adaptation. Extensive experiments show that CoDiRe outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, exceeding CoTTA by 10.55% while using only 48% of its time cost on ImageNet-C.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Recent research indicates that using VLMs yields better RAG performance, but processing rich documents remains a challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Classification Accuracy: Neural-MedBench and the Need for Deeper Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22258v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.</p></details> | 25 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Towards Fine-Grained Recognition with Large Visual Language Models: Benchmark and Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10384v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/pc-inno/FROW.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSPlan: Corrective Sequential Planning via Scene Graph Incremental Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10342v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual VLM Training: Adapting an English-Trained VLM to French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10336v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConStruct: Structural Distillation of Foundation Models for Prototype-Based Weakly Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10316v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[HunyuanOCR Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19575v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents HunyuanOCR, a commercial-grade, open-source, and lightweight (1B parameters) Vision-Language Model (VLM) dedicated to OCR tasks. The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters. HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks. HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning from an Auto-Annotation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10244v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website and code: https://tian1327.github.io/SWIFT</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training. Extensive experiments on RVE-Bench demonstrate that ReViSE significantly enhances editing accuracy and visual fidelity, achieving a 32% improvement of the Overall score in the reasoning-informed video editing subset over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: [this https URL](https://github.com/Liuxinyv/ReViSE)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 table, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: NeurIPS 2025 (main)</p></details> |

However, their ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs, without explicit textual prompts, remains underexplored. We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity. We evaluate 29 VLMs on VisualActBench and find that while frontier models like GPT4o demonstrate relatively strong performance, a significant gap remains compared to human-level reasoning, particularly in generating proactive, high-priority actions. Our results highlight limitations in current VLMs' ability to interpret complex context, anticipate outcomes, and align with human decision-making frameworks. VisualActBench establishes a comprehensive foundation for assessing and improving the real-world readiness of proactive, vision-centric AI agents.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS). 13 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning ("mind") with robot action ("hand"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.</p></details> | 49 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Building Reasonable Inference for Vision-Language Models in Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09555v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in BIQA has been driven by VLMs, whose semantic reasoning abilities suggest that they might extract visual features, generate descriptive text, and infer quality in a human-like manner. However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline. Further analyses show that our method improves both stability and the reliability of the inference process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICONIP (International Conference on Neural Information Processing), 2025</p></details> |

Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology.

| **[Defect-aware Hybrid Prompt Optimization via Progressive Tuning for Zero-Shot Multi-type Anomaly Detection and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09446v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive anomaly detection performance under significant distribution shift by utilizing high-level semantic information through text prompts. However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like "hole", "cut", "scratch" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of "abnormal" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Calibration and Uncertainty Guidance for Class-Incremental Learning based on Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09441v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing ones.</p></details> |  |

We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[COVLM-RL: Critical Object-Oriented Reasoning for Autonomous Driving Using VLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09349v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks face persistent challenges in generalization, training efficiency, and interpretability. While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\% in trained driving environments and by 50\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips. (ii) Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing. We utilize vision-language model (VLM)-based category consensus, local grounding, and diversity-aware pairing to select image pairs. (iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions. In addition, we introduce a benchmark covering subject-driven generation and manipulation, and then evaluate identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency with a VLM judge. Extensive experiments show that training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALIGN: A Vision-Language Framework for High-Accuracy Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06316v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed language (e.g. Bangla-English) scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning), a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident location coordinates directly from available textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language model mechanisms within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data source, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district- and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.</p></details> |  |

However, ICL performance remains unstable even when the in-context demonstrations (ICDs) are well matched, showing that LVLMs still struggle to make full use of the provided context. While existing work mainly focuses on prompt engineering or post-hoc logit calibration, we study the attention mechanisms inside LVLMs to address their inherent limitations. We identify two important weaknesses in their self-attention that hinder effective ICL. To address these weaknesses, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a training-free and plug-and-play method that dynamically adjusts attention logits based on the input in-context sequence. CAMA uses a two-stage modulation process that strengthens attention to semantically important tokens, especially visual ones. Across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and baselines, showing clear effectiveness and generalization. It can also activate the intended benefits of prompt engineering methods and remains robust across different sequence configurations. Therefore, CAMA opens up new directions for improving multimodal reasoning through a deeper understanding of attention dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09172v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> |

Concurrently, large-scale vision language models show remarkable zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we bridge these two worlds by introducing ConceptPose, a framework for object pose estimation that is both training-free and model-free. ConceptPose leverages a vision-language-model (VLM) to create open-vocabulary 3D concept maps, where each point is tagged with a concept vector derived from saliency maps. By establishing robust 3D-3D correspondences across concept maps, our approach allows precise estimation of 6DoF relative pose. Without any object or dataset-specific training, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on common zero shot relative pose estimation benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods by over 62% in ADD(-S) score, including those that utilize extensive dataset-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Diffusion Transformer for High-fidelity Text-Aware Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08922v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs containing degraded textual content. While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task.</p></details> |  |

Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we enhance VLM-based visual grounding in satellite imagery by proposing a novel structured localization mechanism. Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating structured spatial reasoning into VLMs, paving the way for more reliable real-world satellite data analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 80 pages, 37 figures, 29 tables; Project Page at https://worldbench.github.io/worldlens</p></details> |

Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Neural Networks journal</p></details> |

In this work, we develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete tokens.

To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.</p></details> | 25 pages, 27 figures |

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Driving World Model as Synthetic Data Generator for Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19195v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

| **[Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Train-Test Gap in World Models for Gradient-Based Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09929v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models paired with model predictive control (MPC) can be trained offline on large-scale datasets of expert trajectories and enable generalization to a wide range of planning tasks at inference time. Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget.</p></details> |  |

Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://seed-uniugp.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://matrix-game-v2.github.io</p></details> |

Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://playerone-hku.github.io/</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Survey of World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14499v4)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including generative games, autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the original ACM CSUR paper, 49 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended $\unicode{x2014}$ models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time $\unicode{x2014}$ and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template $\unicode{x2014}$ reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring $\unicode{x2014}$ to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/EternalEvan/Astra</p></details> |

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://visionary-laboratory.github.io/visionary</p></details> |
| **[Prismatic World Model: Learning Compositional Dynamics for Planning in Hybrid Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08411v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.</p></details> |  |

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called "empowerment" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. "Empowerment" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Philosophical Transactions A, Special issue: World models, AGI, and the hard problems of life-mind continuity.

While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models.</p></details> |  |

We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often rely on passive observation of spatial data, failing to internalize an active mental imagery process. To bridge this gap, we propose SpatialDreamer, a reinforcement learning framework that enables spatial reasoning through a closedloop process of active exploration, visual imagination via a world model, and evidence-grounded reasoning. To address the lack of fine-grained reward supervision in longhorizontal reasoning tasks, we propose Geometric Policy Optimization (GeoPO), which introduces tree-structured sampling and step-level reward estimation with geometric consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialDreamer delivers highly competitive results across multiple challenging benchmarks, signifying a critical advancement in human-like active spatial mental simulation for MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management.

Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed.

However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation.

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures.

However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Spatial Retrieval Augmented Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06865v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing autonomous driving systems rely on onboard sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, etc) for environmental perception. However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain. In contrast, human drivers are able to recall road structure even under poor visibility. To endow models with this ``recall" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks. For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling. Extensive experiments show that the extended modality could enhance the performance of certain tasks. We will open-source dataset curation code, data, and benchmarks for further study of this new autonomous driving paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo Page: https://spatialretrievalad.github.io/ with open sourced code, dataset, and checkpoints</p></details> |
| **[Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391v3)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing video generation models for this domain are limited to synthesizing short clips of simple actions and often rely on manually defined trajectories. To this end, we introduce MIND-V, a hierarchical framework designed to synthesize physically plausible and logically coherent videos of long-horizon robotic manipulation. Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward. PFC leverages the V-JEPA world model to enforce physical plausibility by aligning the predicted and actual dynamic evolutions in the feature space. MIND-V demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation video generation, establishing a scalable and controllable paradigm for embodied data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Manifold Part 2: Neural Network Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06563v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops the global equations of neural networks through stacked piecewise manifolds, fixed-point theory, and boundary-conditioned iteration. Once fixed coordinates and operators are removed, a neural network appears as a learnable numerical computation shaped by manifold complexity, high-order nonlinearity, and boundary conditions. Real-world data impose strong data complexity, near-infinite scope, scale, and minibatch fragmentation, while training dynamics produce learning complexity through shifting node covers, curvature accumulation, and the rise and decay of plasticity. These forces constrain learnability and explain why capability emerges only when fixed-point regions stabilize. Neural networks do not begin with fixed points; they construct them through residual-driven iteration. This perspective clarifies the limits of monolithic models under geometric and data-induced plasticity and motivates architectures and federated systems that distribute manifold complexity across many elastic models, forming a coherent world-modeling framework grounded in geometry, algebra, fixed points, and real-data complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARSS: Taming Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation for View Synthesis From Single View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23008v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in world modeling tasks, including novel view generation from sparse inputs. However, most existing diffusion-based NVS methods generate target views jointly via an iterative denoising process, which makes it less straightforward to impose a strictly causal structure along a camera trajectory. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce ARSS, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ an off-the-shelf video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose an autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves overall performance comparable to state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models.

| **[SIMPACT: Simulation-Enabled Action Planning using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05955v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable common-sense and semantic reasoning capabilities. However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

| **[World Models That Know When They Don't Know: Controllable Video Generation with Calibrated Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05927v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARTAN: A Sparse Transformer World Model Attending to What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06890v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the interactions between entities in a structured way plays a central role in world models that flexibly adapt to changes in the environment. Recent works motivate the benefits of models that explicitly represent the structure of interactions and formulate the problem as discovering local causal structures. In this work, we demonstrate that reliably capturing these relationships in complex settings remains challenging. To remedy this shortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the discovery of such local structures. To this end, we present the SPARse TrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns context-dependent interaction structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity regularisation on the attention patterns between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN learns sparse, context-dependent interaction graphs that accurately predict future object states. We further extend our model to adapt to sparse interventions with unknown targets in the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly interpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically, we evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric world models in observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model can learn local causal graphs that accurately reflect the underlying interactions between objects, achieving significantly improved few-shot adaptation to dynamics changes, as well as robustness against distractors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the effectiveness of World Models for Spatial Reasoning through Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05809v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |
| **[FieldSeer I: Physics-Guided World Models for Long-Horizon Electromagnetic Dynamics under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05361v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FieldSeer I, a geometry-aware world model that forecasts electromagnetic field dynamics from partial observations in 2-D TE waveguides. The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design.</p></details> |  |

This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems. This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown. We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals. Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

| **[What-If Analysis of Large Language Models: Explore the Game World Using Proactive Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04791v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective at reasoning and information retrieval, but remain unreliable for decision-making in dynamic, partially observable, high-stakes environments such as MOBA games. One key limitation is weak counterfactual reasoning: LLMs struggle to conduct precise what-if analysis over candidate actions and their future consequences. We address this limitation with What-if Analysis LLM (WiA-LLM), a framework that trains an LLM as an explicit language-based world model. Instead of representing the environment in latent vectors, WiA-LLM models how the game state evolves over time with candidate actions using language, and provides textual justifications for these predicted outcomes. This explicit modeling supports (1) interpretability, since the model's predictions and underlying rationales are human-readable, and (2) semantic generalization, as the model can transfer knowledge across situations that share similar game concepts (e.g., roles, objectives, or tactics). WiA-LLM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on human-like reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards that depend on the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth future states. In the Honor of Kings (HoK) environment, WiA-LLM attains 74.2\% accuracy (27\%$\uparrow$ vs. base model) in forecasting game-state changes. In addition, we find that agents with WiA-LLM exhibit closer strategic behavior to expert players than purely reactive LLM agents, indicating more foresight-aware and expert-aligned decision-making.</p></details> |  |

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[X-Humanoid: Robotize Human Videos to Generate Humanoid Videos at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04537v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.
