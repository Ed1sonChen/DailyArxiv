The reported congestion control effects were not caused by the proposed signal timing optimization, but by an incorrect traffic volume scaling factor during evaluation. The traffic demand was not properly amplified, resulting in misleading performance gains. Due to the substantial nature of the error, completion of revisions is not feasible in the short term</p></details> |
